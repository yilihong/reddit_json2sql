{"body":"Tonsof exercizes i can boil down into two basic speaking approaches. Structure of how your mug looks when you speak certain tones and the sound of reserved staccatos and lively stresses on melodic m's and other consonants. Vowels have a shape. Consonants a sound.\n\nStart out by picking a sentence which you think incorporates all which your training requires. Much like the fox sentence with typing. Seeing that im the one doling out free info and with prior teaching exp. i will do my best to provide you with a dramatically written action statement directly relatable to any script today. What makes it actionized is the action words themeslves and the use of forward direct keywords rather than saying ill do it later one might say im planning on doing it later. Planning being the keyword compared to will. Some thing is happening even if later but the character is reacting in a way that demands a reaction. A keyword demands a keypoint and even a keyscene changing moment to leave or inteoduce a new or different character. So just say that sentence. Are you really lazy so as to put ot off for just not wanting to do it or are you good on your word? Its not that its a longer sentence though. Here is a short actionized sentence. Fuck her.  And see what i mean if a schizo can only give you one word unmeaningless answers that will only be required for a schizo lol.\n\nBtw thanks for reminding me of this.

You don't point a gun at anyone unless you're going to pull the trigger and once you do you pull it until no more bullets come out. \n\nProper gun handling aside, that fucker got what he deserved. \n\nEdit: I've read a lot of positive feedback and some fair criticisms. To be clear, shooting someone who's down when there is no immediate threat to your or your family's life is murder. And if you can retreat safely you should always do so. The goal is deescalation and avoiding violence. \n\nHowever I've seen far too many people who continue to say this woman had no justification to shoot her stalker who was in the process of breaking into her house. While they're a minority, they're a loud one. To them: do you people have any empathy that you could imagine what it would be like to be her in that moment after months of carrying a gun everywhere she went out of fear because of constant harassment and threats? \n\nA couple of these people are regular members of women-hating subs and I wonder if their views on women may have something to do with their ability to empathize more with a man who was likely going to rape and kill than with the woman he targeted as his victim. \n\nAlways take your friends seriously if any of them come to you and say they've been hurt, stalked, or threatened by someone else. Put yourself in his or her shoes and offer what you can as far as support and safety. Even if you don't have proof that something happened, you can't go wrong by offering support and safety just in case.

{"body":"Close. Technically, $7,320.63. \n\nAnd shipping is only 7 euro unless you're shipping to anywhere outside of the country. How that works, since it comes fully assembled, let alone that it probably weighs a ton and would take up a lot of space regardless, is beyond me. I'm thinking that's just their standard shipping price for most stuff and not an actual shipping cost approximation for this item. \n\nStill though, $7k... Well, they probably have everything pre-fabricated and more or less ready to assemble once it gets to them and since they're doing individual, limited orders, that's probably going to cost a lot. Material cost, manufacturing cost, time and labor... Yeah, I'd bet that thing runs them about $4k at most to make. Selling it at $7k is pretty fair. I mean, you want to make money, not break even. If you sold it for $5k, you'd only make a grand per unit, which likely aren't going to be many. It might simply not be worth it. And the kind of people who can afford anything above $3k for something like this, can probably afford anything like this for less than $10k, so why not sell it for more? I can't imagine lowering the price would increase sales enough to make up for the loss. \n\nIf an actual manufacturer came out with this thing though, I'd bet we'd see it for $3.999.98 USD.

{"body":"Stalin was unprepared in 1941, he thought the alliance would give him time to prepare, after he purged the army of it's leadership in the late 1930s.  But it's a valid argument to say that he planned to eventually break it off and invade.  N\n\nThe ironic part probably is that it would have been to Hitler's benefit if he waited for that invasion and used his half of Poland as a cushion against it.  He could have concentrated on Gibraltar and the Afrika Corp instead and cutting off Britain, and eventually come to terms with them first... and second, Russia has been historically horrible at invasions as seen with Finland and Ukraine just the latest example.  \n\nIt would have given the Germans the moral advantage (in this single case), been hoisted as a fight for their Fatherland, made the logistics much simpler (Russian airforce wasn't really something to worry about so bombing fears from that direction is nearly nonexistent), and would have had the Russians throw everything they had to the front first, and made it more probable that Stalin would have truly lost the country had the Wehrmacht reached Moscow on it's counterattack.  Also, if the Soviets attaced first and Pearl Harbor still happened, America may not have gone the lend lease route with Russia and stayed out of the European war as Hitler declared war on them first is some attempt to get the Japanese to help attack Russia in it's rear.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_offensive_plans_controversy\nand\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Purge#Purge_of_the_army","score_hidden":"false","archived":"false","name":"t1_cnastg9","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1420071689","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh13","link_id":"t3_2qxelx","parent_id":"t1_cnamfst","score":"2","retrieved_on":"1425124017","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cnastg9","subreddit":"worldnews","ups":"2","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

Most restaurants make their menu available (be it online or printed) before you actually go there. And if they don't, I'll call in and ask if they have any vegan entrees (or entrees which can be easily modified to be vegan). I've never had a problem going to a restaurant only to find out that there are no vegan options I would like. I've never heard of it happening with any of my friends who are vegan, either. The only times I've ever heard of that happening are people who are looking to make a scene, not people who are simply trying to sit down for a meal. Most vegetarians and vegans are used to putting in a little extra effort in regulating their diet in the first place.

{"body":"In high school, I fell out with my entire friend group because I caught on that I was just the kid to keep around and make fun of, so I cut them all out of my life. That was a shitty sophomore year, but the following two years were great. But it's also when I met my ex-best friend, and my ex-girlfriend. \n\nFlash forward to college, my ex-best friend, ex-girlfriend, and I all ended up at the same school by chance. Over the last three and a half years, my ex-best friend and I were like brothers. I helped him through some of the toughest times he's ever gone through. We even decided to move-in together when we graduated.\n\nLet's go back to two months ago. It's halfway through my first semester of senior year when I had finally come to terms that I was depressed, and started to find help for it. I broke up with my ex-girlfriend, but I never stopped loving her. I just didn't want her to wait around for me to get better. I felt like I was only dragging her down, and that eventually, I would make her miserable. So I decided to let her go. \n\nIt turns out that right after we broke up, my ex-best friend started trying to sleep with my ex-girlfriend. For weeks, he kept saying things like, \"He doesn't have to know.\" or \"He doesn't love you anymore.\" My ex-best friend took advantage of her vulnerability and her loneliness, and she gave into his persistence. And for weeks, my ex-best friend pretended like everything was fine right in front of my face.\n\nWhen I found out about it from my ex-girlfriend, I had to see emergency counseling because I was incredibly tempted to just jump under the next bus I saw. \n\nI know that I made my share of poor choices. And I know they're both adults that can make their own decisions, but I can't help but feel betrayed. I have decided to forgive them both, and to let go of any negative feelings about it. Why am I forgiving them so easily you might ask? It's actually pretty funny. When I was at my lowest point, I came across an askreddit thread about the best quotes, and the following three really struck home with me.\n\n* \"Forgive others, not because they deserve your forgiveness but because you deserve peace.\"  - Jonathan Lockwood Huie\n* \"Years of love have been forgot, in the hatred of a minute.\" - Edgar Allan Poe\n* \u201cHolding onto anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die.\u201d - Buddha\n\nSince I found out, I have separated myself from my ex-best friend, and I haven't spoken to him. But I plan to soon.\n\nI spoke to my ex-girlfriend. Turns out she still loves me, and half of me loves that. But the other half can't come to trust her anymore. I guess I'll have to struggle with that for a bit.\n\nThanks for reading!","score_hidden":"false","archived":"false","name":"t1_cnasyvr","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1420072022","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i","link_id":"t3_2qxogl","parent_id":"t3_2qxogl","score":"1","retrieved_on":"1425123947","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cnasyvr","subreddit":"AskReddit","ups":"1","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

{"body":"I just don't feel like typing out a few paragraphs to do so. I have better things to do. \n\nA few things, though. Ask a young person from the former Soviet Union (I know a great many) how they feel about Communism. Secondly, you may think Hitler was a fascist. (A great many do, and they're not necessarily wrong. But . . .) Now go and find out what the word Nazi means and ask yourself the difference between socialism and fascism. On that track, ask yourself if you really know the real reasons for the French Revolution, the Bolshevik Revolution, the Vietnam War, the September 11th attacks (you seem like someone who might have done some thinking on those), and even the American Civil War and the American Revolution itself.\n\nYou seem to be pointed in mostly the right direction, but a lot of what you're saying suggests that you're still looking at things the wrong way. This wrong way is the way most who are calling for \"revolution,\" calling for an end to the big bad corporations (not the people who run them, usually, just the names of the corporations and the corporationy stuff they do), and so much more, are seeming to be going about things. They don't know what's going on, and they probably never will, and they'll for so long think they're \"uniting\", \"fighting the power,\" and that likely won't really be the case at all. But, hey, worked out pretty well in the 60's. And there's France and the fallen Soviet Union, as well as China and North Korea. Power to the people, my nigga.\n\nLastly, I assume you're American, look at the dollar bill and think about it. You also seem like the kind who's thought about the symbols on the dollar bill once or twice. What do you really know about them? Do you really ask the tough questions, or are you more \"inside the box\" than you like to think? You gonna vote in the next Presidential election? For a leader who will surely change things? \n\nAny question I asked is rhetorical. I don't fuck with Reddit much any more because most of it stinks of what I'm referring to here, and what you evinced in your CORPORATISM post. I'm open to further discussion, depending, but things like this really are a waste of time. \n\nOne more, since my replying to this has put the issue on my mind: Consider democracy. Do you know what democracy is, especially in its purest form? It guarantees the rights of all, correct? Gives everyone a voice?

{"body":"I just skimmed this over, so if I don't address your question or whatever, whatever. 350 dps is what you should aim for. If you are hitting that regularly, you are fine. The fight has a LOT of down time to ruin your final dps numbers. If you make it past heavens fall, you really don't need to worry too much about dps anymore. You just gotta dance the dance and survive. Anything above 250 dps for last phase is enough to beat the enrage timer as long as ppl survive.\n\nThat said, here's some tips to help your dps. Time your songs so they happen during break periods like between MF and HF. Multi dot whenever possible. Have a dragoon in the party. Always use CDs as soon as you can. Don't forget that BV foes is a huge boost to Mage and summoner damage that you also contribute.\n\nBut realistically, as I said before, anything higher than 350 dps for full fight is perfectly fine and ppl who say it is low don't realize that that is better than 90% of other players in similar gear.

{"body":"The theory is incomplete and not particularly useful unless put into the perspective of prevailing social power structures - structures which incidentally both predate and transcend our whole species and may in fact be sourced from our primate past.\n\nIt's very simple really.  The larger and more powerful member of the species sets the social terms for the species.  The member of the species which carries the offspring is the more genetically important member of the species.\n\nIn those species were the female is the dominant one, males compete mostly to fertilize her amongst themselves and avoid her wrath.  They then run as fast as they can.  In some deep dwelling creatures, the male is almost entirely superfluous to the point of melting itself to form a pair of testicles for the use of the female.  In some species, mating is so dangerous that you have to penetrate the female by sheer force and then run for your life.\n\nIn humans, it is only a chance of evolution (and largely a holdover from our primate evolution) that caused the male of the species to be larger than the female.  We aren't even a particularly dimorphic species.  Adult gorillas vary by a fact of 2 between species.  Chimpanzees, being closer relatives of ours, are closer.\n\nPatriarchy theory makes very little sense in that it requires a conspiracy where none exists.  All that is required and would have been required for men to dominate women throughout human history is for it to be socially advantageous for men to do so.  Given that men are responsible for virtually all potentially damaging physical activity, are likely to be fitter, have lower required fat deposits and shorter life spans than women, they were always going to dominate society.  While their social and biological value is lower, strong and fit males have a much higher biological value than weak and unfit males.  This was always going to select in favour of aggression!\n\nIt is a triumph of our humanism that we have now begun to expand beyond this point.  For much of our species existence, however, it was not only important but likely socially advantageous.\n\nEDIT:  I should note, by the way, that I am mainly considering the bulk of our 200-300,000 year history, not the last five hundred years.  It would be absurd not to consider the last 2-3000 years (less than 1% of our species history) as an indicator of enormous social change.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"false","name":"t1_cnat6ev","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1420072489","subreddit_id":"t5_33726","link_id":"t3_2qx5w5","parent_id":"t1_cnaqsjn","score":"3","retrieved_on":"1425123849","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cnat6ev","subreddit":"KotakuInAction","ups":"3","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

{"body":"Actually nowadays you do not have to be a nerd or hobbyist to make your own pc. While saying it's as easy as building legos may be misleading if you set aside 4-5 hours of a day in order to save $500 it can be great fun. If you read instructions correctly and know how to use the internet it isn't hard. People are catching on to this and more and more people are making their own pc's. Mac's are not better for most people, most people do not need a pc that is over $500, in fact a lot of people don't even need a pc. Most people would be just fine living their life without a pc or a mac, smartphones can do almost everything an average person would want to do. If they do in fact need a desktop/laptop then getting a windows pc would be the best, you can save $100-$200 on a prebuilt by getting windows and it will perform just as fast if not faster. You saying 99% of pc builders do it for gaming isn't true. The company I work for gives us a price limit on workstation computers and allows us to build them if we so please.

{"body":"3 replies, 0 relevance to what I mentioned.\n\n&gt; Really? the number of people a government murders is completely irrelevant to your evaluation of it? In that case, you must love pinochet, massive economic growth and nothing bad happened that's worth mentioning!\n\nIt means the number of deaths doesn't define a form of government. Read it twice if you must.\n\n&gt; No, you couldn't. what part of \"us policy never starved tens of millions to death\" are you having trouble with?\n\nNo, US foreign policy doesn't do that. Did I say that though? no I didn't.  However, US foreign policy does cause the deaths of thousands of people.  Over half a million people have died from the iraq war alone (may I remind you that this war was deemed unnecesary by many world leaders). Pinochet, the guy you're making fun of, killed 3k in his own country. I'm not from chile btw.\n\n&gt; I never said it was. I said the consequences of american ideology are better because they result in fewer deaths, period. Not zero deaths, but fewer.\n\nYou don't seem to understand. I dont care about american, nor soviet ideology. But you're completely wrong in denouncing someone who speaks for commmunism as a regime apologist (jerk), then insisting that communism is defined by the actions of the soviets and chinese, all the while saying america is merely \"imperfect\" for it's mistakes. That makes you an apologist of authoritarian regimes  and overall american foreign policy (which has resulted in several hundred thousand deaths, even if not famine related (doesn't make a death any less death anyways)). It also makes you a hypocrite for downplaying the horrible \"mistakes\" (which were very  much purposeful) that the US has done and not accepting them as part of their identity. Those mistakes that  just keep on happening, up until this day.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"false","name":"t1_cnat98a","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1420072679","subreddit_id":"t5_2sfmf","link_id":"t3_2qxaaf","parent_id":"t1_cnarl4q","score":"-1","retrieved_on":"1425123813","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cnat98a","subreddit":"PoliticalDiscussion","ups":"-1","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

{"body":"Your submission was removed for breaking Rule #2.\n\n&gt; **The use of the [XPOST] tag/label is banned.** The [XPOST] system is flawed and surprisingly destructive to sharing content on Reddit.\n\n&gt; That being being said, **xposting content from other subreddits is totally fine** and encouraged. Just don't label your xposts as xposts. If for some reason you really feel the need to tell people you found the link elsewhere on Reddit, say so in a comment below your post \u2014 NOT in the title. (You are required to do this if the content is original content authored by another redditor)\n\n&gt; **TL;DR version of the reason behind this policy:**\n\n&gt; Lots of people have been receiving downvotes and nasty comments by other people accusing them of content theft because they didn't use [xpost] tags. That's obviously silly since **Reddit automatically tags all xposts** in the discussions tab at the top of every xpost. This kind of downvoting and hostility has been such a negative and prevalent force on reddit that the only fix seems to be raising an awareness about the issue by banning xpost tags and getting people to drop that weird, accusatory, and pointless system.\n\nThe full explanation for this policy, with examples, can be found at [our wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/wiki/index#wiki_.5Bxpost.5D_tags.2Flabels_are_banned).\n\nIf you would like to try again, follow these steps:\n\n1. Delete your post\n2. Repost it with a proper title. (that does not include the words \"crosspost\" or \"xpost\" or any variation of those words)\n\nNote: If you don't delete your post, you won't be able to repost the same link.\n\nThank you for your patience and assistance in ridding reddit of the harmful [xpost] tagging system.\n\n\n*[I am a bot](/r/AutoModerator/comments/q11pu/what_is_automoderator/), and this action was performed automatically.

{"body":"Same. Though I feel like I'm trapped in limbo when it comes to caffeine.\n\nWhen I have it, I binge. Like 4 rockstars a day, or lots of coffee and soda. When I cold turkey I feel amazing...for the first two days. Mental clarity, sleep is better etc etc. But then I get the horrible withdrawal, lethargy, headaches, etc etc.\n\nWell then you might say \"well just wean yourself down\" but that's no so easy either. Because yeah if I wean down there's still caffeine in my system, but that's the problem. There's STILL caffeine in my system. And instead of it being a huge amount making me either feel great or neurotic, or having nothing in me and feeling like shit, I just feel off kilter and out of it. And there's this uneasiness feeling inside me that just lingers and it sucks.\n\nBut yeah that mental clarity is amazing. It just feels like everything clicks into place. I can distinguish between my real thoughts and my bullshit anxiety thoughts and make them go away. The day just kind of flows inside of having a ton of ups and downs. It's a bit more \"boring\" especially when it's a long work day with no caffeine, but it's more...stable I guess.\n\nIt's hard to start and I find I usually have to get to a breaking point, or just have a really good day where I feel okay quitting to muster up that willpower. My last go I made it 9 days without any kind of caffeine whatsoever, and then I started a new job and everyone there was drinking this new super awesome brand of Rockstar (the sour apple with extra caffeine), I decided to give it a shot and relapsed bad. But yeah I'm back trying again tonight as my new years resolution.

He really glosses over the Figaro bit, and if Figaro did something wrong, it should be in there and also reported to the author.\n\nHaving worked with Figaro in the past, the basic workflow is: `figaro install` which creates an empty application.yml file in the config directory, and adds a line to the .gitignore file to ignore that file (I have used Figaro two dozen times, this has never yet failed to happen). Then, any time you alter application.yml, and you are using Heroku, you run a command to push those changes up as config keys on Heroku (Note, it just sets config keys...does not push the config file itself). If you are using capistrano or another mechanism to deploy, you will generally just sftp the config file to the server straight from your machine.\n\n(I actually just tried all possible things you could do with Figaro and /cannot/ reproduce this, so I am not sure what he did.)","score_hidden":"false","archived":"false","name":"t1_cnatjvm","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1420073374","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_2qwsew","parent_id":"t3_2qwsew","score":"2","retrieved_on":"1425123675","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cnatjvm","subreddit":"programming","ups":"2","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

{"body":"I think $235 for a quality-made and fully painted set is pretty fair. I mean, go into any hobby shop and buy something that is of noteworthy quality, painted or unpainted, and you're going to pay similar prices.\n\nPeople just don't understand how much time it takes to make stuff, maybe because we're so used to seeing machines make them. It's one of those cases where there's just a lot more to something than what first meets the eye. \n\nI built my own blackjack/poker table awhile back and used the most inexpensive parts and tools I could find, without sacrificing structural integrity since that would just end up costing you more in the long run. Including cards and chips and all that, I spent about $600. Excluding tools, about $500. The funny thing is, I really doubt I could sell it for more than $300. Of course, part of that is due to design. With a good design, I could probably break even without considering cost of tools, which is fine since I get to keep those and so they can be used again down the road. But why would I want to spend my time breaking even? Now, if I broke even after also paying my expenses to, you know, live and stuff... sure, I might do it and see where it goes, but saving money for who knows what is also important... \n\nPeople only ever think of something like cost of materials and then they say, \"well that's just too expensive\". They don't really get it. I'm a living thing that needs fuel and maintenance, I also have a conscious so just like yourself I tend to value what little time I have on this planet, and the materials I'm using, regardless of whether they're cheap or expensive, are better than what you're going to get from most Made in China manufacturers. And all of that still isn't taking into consideration cost of other things which are all part of the process, directly or indirectly, of making stuff by hand. \n\n$175/$235 are fair prices. I can't imagine you're making too much on them after it's all said and done. Resin, paint, tools, molds, faulty casts since you're not a robot pumping out cheap crap, personal expenses since dead people don't make stuff... Shit, do you even make anything or is this just a hobby that pays for itself?

{"body":"2014 was my first full year of Melee. I think I've done pretty well figuring out how this game works, and I'm happy with my game knowledge and execution now versus late 2013. I'm not even close to content, yet, but I think my rate of improvement is satisfactory.\n\nMy most important revolution happened more recently. For a long time, I was struggling with whether I wanted to play Fox or Falcon. I started as a Fox main, but Falcon was the character I truly wanted to play. The thing is, I wanted to prove my ability in-game. I wanted to place well in tournament. I wanted this, because I felt like people were dismissive of me, or didn't take me seriously, because of my placement and perceived skill level. I think that cliquey-ness and exclusive behavior is definitely a real thing in the melee community, and becomes more prevalent the smaller a scene is. However, I realized two things:\n\n1. Peoples' opinion of me does not have nearly as much weight as I previously gave it (as cliche as that sounds)\n\n2. I'm more accepted by the area I live in than I realized.\n\nIt's a weight off my shoulders to feel my thirst for improvement stay at the same magnitude, but change directions. I want to improve now for myself rather than to show other people they were wrong. Part of this is my own childishness, which I fully admit. Part of it. I now realize, though, how silly it is to keep playing Fox.\n\nGoing into 2015, I want to improve on my general execution in-game. I think I have a good handle on WHAT to do, I just need to get myself to the point where I can execute better.\n\nMy short term goals are just to place well at the local/regional tournaments around me and just overall improve my game. I want to know how Melee works more than I do now.\n\nMy long-term goal is similar. I want to at least be the best in Texas, but I'm not sure if I have the drive to win EVO. I'll cross that bridge when I come to it, it's pretty pointless to think that far ahead.\n\nOne final thing about going into 2015 is that I will not be very present here anymore. Looking at the amount of karma I've amassed, and how often I post, it's clear that I use reddit too much and could use my time much more wisely. I don't know how long it'll be until I come back, if I even come back at all. I do want to say, though, that I really enjoyed the discussions I had with you all here. \n\nThis has mostly been a stream of consciousness, rambling post, so I hope it's decipherable, lol. I'll end it here before it gets to be too much of a sappy mess.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"false","name":"t1_cnatucd","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1420074064","subreddit_id":"t5_2so9j","link_id":"t3_2qyfy6","parent_id":"t3_2qyfy6","score":"1","retrieved_on":"1425123539","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cnatucd","subreddit":"SSBM","ups":"1","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

He was ineffective for the most part because he had little to no movement on his breaking balls and his fastball didn't have enough movement to compensate for his lack of velocity. Dickey first experimented with the knuckleball to start the '05 season and was given a look in the 5th starter spot, but lost it pretty quickly.

{"body":"I used to own this machine. For the sale price of $1500 its awesome. Here are the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n\n* Solid processor - Sager, MSI, Asus, etc. Use the same Core i7-4710HQ in all their mid-range gaming laptops (for $200-$600 more usually) \n* RAM - Lenovo has 2 8GB sticks and the machine runs well on the dual channels\n* Solid GPU - a lot of the gaming computer sellers are using Nvidia 900 series cards but for the price the 860 is awesome. \n* Beautiful display - Looks great, especially for the price. Super crisp and games look awesome. \n\n\nCons:\n\n* The SSD - Not the best SSD. If you have the money, get the cheaper model without the SSD and buy a Samsung Pro 512 SSD or OCZ 512 SSD and put it in there instead. It will cost a little bit more but the model of SSD they come with (I don't 100% remember the model but I think its a budget Intel with slower read/writes) isn't quite as good. That being said, and SSD no matter the quality is still insanely fast when compared to a normal hard drive. (Update: looked at Newegg, they have a [Samsung 840 Pro SSD](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820147194) for $299.99. If you buy the $1,299.00 model and order this SSD you'll get an awesome SSD for that computer. Or, a [Samsung 850 Pro for $345](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820147361))\n\n* The body - For some reason the Ideapad Y series has some of the cheapest easiest-to-break plastic ever.

{"body":"Thank you for reading my comments. I didn't mention that I am on disability benefits and Medicaid. The day that Obama Care went into affect, my long time psychiatrist called me to let me know that they were no longer taking Medicaid. I freaked out because they were giving me benzodiazepines for the facial problems and I was able to drive. So I set out to find a new shrink. I got online to the provider dir and called every number on the list. Not one was taking Medicaid anymore. So I suffered and sometimes would have to go without food and other supplies for the house because I don't know anyone where I live. Finally, out of desperation I went in to see my PCP, we have a good relationship and he was my uncle's PCP also. So I told him everything and he said that he would give me 1mg ativan 2x day and a muscle relaxer. I went back the next month and he said that he could treat me for the pain and also stay on the ativan but I have to sign a pain contract. I am not sure what to do because I am extremely uncomfortable with that, even though I would easily pass. But he said that I would have a file with the DEA and they have audits. I have a problem with that. Well a friend from high school came over and gave me a small bag of weed even though I don't smoke it, he said just keep it incase you need it. Twice last month I considered smoking some because my pain was off the charts. Both times I decided not to. If I do that and my PCP says he can't give me any meds until I drug test I am going to be in deep water. So, I don't know what to do.

{"body":"Your answer completely goes against what you said yourself.\n\n&gt;Since when has blizzard EVER had a ladder that actually was representative of skill? Answer is never.\n\nSo, let's assume you are as amazing as you say. You say Blizzard's ladder is NOT a representation of skill. Yet, you're using those exact rankings to show that you're good, i.e. you have 'skill'. So which is it? Blizzard's ranking system works, and you are as good as you say. OR it's not, and your bragging about being all that is meaningless because it's not an accurate representation of skill?\n\nNow, before you claim that wasn't your point, that it's actually about the \"boosters\" and \"hackers\". 1) There will always be hackers in every game. It's just a fact. Some people don't care about gameplay, they just want to show off how 'good' their are via hacking their way to the top of the rankings. and 2) 'Boosted accounts\" will quickly end up falling down the ladder if the person who got boosted doesn't belong in that rank. Over time, that player will be paired up vs people who belong at that rank, lose, fall off, and be forced to go buy another boosted account.\n\nNow, there is an issue if said boosted accounts can remain in those ladders indefinitely. For an extreme example, let's take Starcraft 2's GM rank. Only 200 people can get in there, and if those were locked to the first 200 players (as it was early in SC2's history), these accounts could be boosted quickly to the top and stay there forever. But if these players decide NOT to play (in hopes of staying in GM forever), then you'll never be matched against them. If these players DO play, then they'll find out that they're not as actually as good as real GM players.\n\nI have no idea what you're trying to say because you're contradicting yourself.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"false","name":"t1_cnauoxi","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1420076101","subreddit_id":"t5_2ym13","link_id":"t3_2qylp1","parent_id":"t1_cnat3d7","score":"7","retrieved_on":"1425123143","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cnauoxi","subreddit":"heroesofthestorm","ups":"7","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

{"body":"I got a lot of 'em:  \n\nWhat is each end of the [Naked 3 brush](http://i.imgur.com/QmBAKDz.jpg) supposed to be used for? There's the bigger, fluffier end, and then the smaller tighter end. Which one should I use for which task? Also I have a Sephora Pro #16 Domed crease brush, a #19 Tapered crease brush, and a #27 Blending brush. When should I use those?  \n\nI remember from a class at Sephora that the #19 is for the crease, because it's tapered and fits nicely in the crease. And the #16 is for the corner - according to my notes from the class it's for using a dark color in the corner and making a 'C' shape. Although I'm honestly not super sure *how* to do that. I tried earlier, and I wound up with just these dark circles at the edges of my eyes. So how am I supposed to do the dark colors at the corners?  \nThey never brought up the #27 in class - I don't really know why I bought it, to be honest.  \n\nWhat hand do I use to apply makeup? I'm right-handed, so do I use my right hand for *everything*, or should I use my left hand when applying makeup to the left side of my face?   \n\nHow do I put on eyeliner without fidgeting or tremors? It always starts ok, then I guess my hand just panics and I always end up with smudges and stray bits of liner. I try to use the method they taught me in class at Sephora of wiggling it, drawing a tiny line, stopping, wiggling again, etc. Would attempting to draw one continuous line from the outer corner in be any easier, or would that just be a fool's errand?  \n\nAnd are there any videos and/or tutorials that go into great detail on how to apply things like eyeshadow or foundation? The ones I've seen all expect the viewer to have some basic skills already. I need someone to explain it to me like I just came to this planet and have no frame of reference. And ideally very specific - like how much liquid foundation to put on the brush, how many brush strokes to use per area of the face, how to avoid streaking, etc. Whenever I use my brush, it always looks like I clearly painted my face with flesh-colored paint. How do I make it nice and even?","score_hidden":"false","archived":"false","name":"t1_cnausus","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1420076372","subreddit_id":"t5_2rww2","link_id":"t3_2qvxej","parent_id":"t3_2qvxej","score":"2","retrieved_on":"1425123092","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cnausus","subreddit":"MakeupAddiction","ups":"2","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

{"body":"Your post has been automatically removed by this bot because your title is incorrect.\n\n**Trading Items.** Your title must appear like this: [H] Item or items you have [W] Item or items wanted\n\nThe full details of the trade are not required to be in the title, but if not they must be in the description. However, you must say what you are willing to accept as an offer in your title. For example, \"[H] Sandman [W] Offers\" is inappropriate. However, \"[H] Sandman [W] Offers in Metal/Keys/Promos\" is acceptable as long as a specific price is listed in the trade description.\n\nIf you are selling more than 5 items, you can instead use the [Store] tag. Note that all relevant trade info still needs to be within the post without requiring the user to view an external site. Simply linking to a pricing spreadsheet site or a different trade site to sell your items is not sufficient by itself to meet the pricing rule.\n\n**Other types of appropriate titles.** You may also use the following tags for *non-trade* posts.\n\n1. [PC] - Asking for a price check on an item.\n2. [Q] - Asking a trading-related question.\n3. [PSA] - Public service announcements of great community importance.\n4. [Raffle] - If you intend on doing a free raffle (raffles with any sort of buy-in are prohibited).\n5. [Contest] - If you are holding a contest to give away free things.\n6. [Free], [Giveaway] - If you are giving something away for free, you can use either one of these tags.\n\n**Tag Formatting.** The tag used must start the post title, and some text after the tag is required. Extraneous text within tag brackets will cause the post to be removed. For trade posts, [H] must start the title (come before [W]).\n\n**Scammers.** If you are attempting to report a scammer on our game servers, please review [this post](http://redd.it/mbpbg) and follow the process within it. If the scammer originated from our subreddit instead, please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftf2trade). If the scammer is not related to our community, please direct your report to [SteamRep](http://forums.steamrep.com/forums/report/).

[PC] - Asking for a price check on an item.\n2. [Q] - Asking a trading-related question.\n3. [PSA] - Public service announcements of great community importance.\n4. [Raffle] - If you intend on doing a free raffle (raffles with any sort of buy-in are prohibited).\n5. [Contest] - If you are holding a contest to give away free things.\n6. [Free], [Giveaway] - If you are giving something away for free, you can use either one of these tags.\n\n**Tag Formatting.** The tag used must start the post title, and some text after the tag is required. Extraneous text within tag brackets will cause the post to be removed. For trade posts, [H] must start the title (come before [W]).\n\n**Scammers.** If you are attempting to report a scammer on our game servers, please review [this post](http://redd.it/mbpbg) and follow the process within it.

Then it also turned out to be hard to find an apartment. Meanwhile, we haven't been able to find anyone to take over our lease on our old house.

{"body":"Yeah, my biggest reason for getting the 3DS is that I wanted to play the revamped Ocarina of Time. Just started it tonight. I agree that the 3D is a bit headache-inducing. I've been keeping it turned down all the way so that it's not as bad. I'm hoping I'll adjust after playing for a few hours. I've already gotten pretty good about keeping it in the right spot relative to my face/eyes.\n\nAs for NYE, I feel you. I feel like I've made mistakes this year too - mostly by not doing the right things rather than doing the wrong things. I'm especially bummed about relationship stuff. I actually just got engaged - which should be awesome - but it's actually brought some of our problems into focus. I think it will be a good thing in the long run and we'll make our relationship better, but right now I feel like shit and my SO does too. Not really how I pictured that part of my life going, haha. I do like that January 1st feeling though. I'm looking forward to waking up tomorrow. I know it's really just an arbitrary day, but I still end up feeling optimistic every year. In contrast, I almost always feel down on NYE.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"false","name":"t1_cnav6p6","author":"SJtheFox","author_flair_text":"Life is hard for strange reasons sometimes.","downs":"0","created_utc":"1420077340","subreddit_id":"t5_323oy","link_id":"t3_2qyw6g","parent_id":"t1_cnatuqw","score":"2","retrieved_on":"1425122913","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cnav6p6","subreddit":"CasualConversation","ups":"2","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":"blue"}

{"body":"&gt; That's an impressive strawman you've built up. Nobody argues that all the world's woes would be solved if Islam went away, just as I imagine most people didn't argue that defeating Nazism during WW2 would create everlasting world peace. But of course that wasn't a good excuse to leave Nazism alone in 1939, just like it's not a good excuse to ignore Islam today. Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good as they say.\n&gt; \n\nWell to say that Islam is the only religion that is an issue is just stupid and wrong. Is islam a threat? Yes. Is it the only threat out there as far as religion is concerned? No. To ignore Islam's threat is stupid, but to then say we should ignore all other religions or dismiss them as harmless is just as retarded. Every time someone brings up violence in other religions the same response is called out \"HURR DURR IT'S NOT ISLAM!\" \n\n&gt;And just because Hitler used rosy, religious language to galvanise the German people doesn't mean he was a Christian extremist, that's so absurd it's almost not worth mentioning. You might as well argue that Thomas Jefferson was a religious extremist because he talked about God and a creator in the American Declaration of Independence, even though by all accounts he was as secular people got back then. You should read up on Hitler's religious views.. Most historians agree that he allied himself with Christianity when it was politically useful but in his private was a deeply secular person. As the historian Laurence Rees concluded \"Hitler's relationship in public to Christianity - indeed his relationship to religion in general - was opportunistic. There is no evidence that Hitler himself, in his personal life, ever expressed any individual belief in the basic tenets of the Christian church\".\n\nAs a history buff myself I can say that Hitler, Nazism and indeed Neo Nazism is very much Christian. The argument that Hitler wasn't religious and used religion as a way to garner more support simply doesn't hold water with many people. He was, by all accounts very religious, traditionally so, even. He justified his acts using religion and his acts were religious, they were wiping out the foreign, non christian influence in favour of Christian influence. The only documents that support that Hitler was non religious was his \"Table talk\", a document that to a lot of historians is controversial. The table talk, which was recorded \"for posterity\" also recorded Hitler as saying the Holocaust was not happening. I do not believe a lot of the table talk is that trustworthy.\n\n&gt;And finally, I'm not really interested in talking about religious extremism that occurred 500 years ago. Christianity has grown up like most other religions and divorced itself from obnoxious piety. It's not a coincidence that Buddhists and Mormons aren't flying planes into office buildings in the 21st century.\n\nHas it? I'm sorry, but that's bullshit. Religion hasn't \"matured\", it's just learnt how to use PR. Lets have a quick look at the clusterfuck that is Uganda. The Ugandans, with encouragement from religious leaders both in Uganda and the USA, are trying to pass a law that would see not only gay people put to death, but effectively anyone who didn't report them. This law was the result of talks, visits and campaigns from Christian pastors from the USA, some of whom have links to the US Government. Now the reason why this law hasn't passed yet isn't because \"it's a fucked up law\", no. It's because of a technicality in the constitution which is quickly being remedied. \n\nYou know the Anti-Gay propaganda law in Russia, you know, the one being used to arrest people for holding hands, raid people's homes and even dismiss rape cases, guess who's behind that? The Russian Church.\n\nIreland, with the help of it's church, have basically turned pregnant women into nothing but incubators. One woman was killed after being denied an abortion for a baby that was already dead, one woman who died was kept on life support to the point she began to rot because she was pregnant at the time. They cut open women's vaginas rather than give them caesareans. Why? Because religion. No other reason.\n\nIn the USA we have laws that make having a miscarriage an arrestable offense. There's a law that require doctors to shove an ultrasound dildo up you and actively lie to you on medical matters. In one state, you have to lie to children about homosesxuality being legal. Michigan is passing a law that will allow EMTs to let people die on religious grounds. In one state, you can bully someone on religious grounds in schools and teachers can't stop it. There's states where a pharmacist can deny you your meds because their imaginary friend told them to, Louisiana is funding a science program that teaches the Loch Ness Monster exists and all of this is due to religion. There are pastors and churches calling for the death of homosexuals, people of different religions amongst others, and indeed, people doing just that and everyone just ignores it. Christianity isn't as violent as Islam because it's better, they're less violent because they don't have to be violent to get their way. If they want something or want to do something, they can do it with impunity. Christianity is in a place Islam can only dream of, they can pass bullshit, theocratic laws and get away with it. If these laws were passed through pressure from Muslims, they'd be riots. And lets not even get into people like \"Crusader for Christendom\" Anders Brevik and the like.\n\nEven Buddhism, fucking buddhism, Mister \"I'm so fucking peaceful\" itself, is getting in on the act. In Myanmar, Buddhist mobs are raiding Muslim areas and villages and killing Muslims there. Men, Women and children are being killed by this apparently peaceful religion. 140,000 people have fled their homes because of this. Oh, and you know how Muslim countries arrest people for insulting Mohammed? People are being arrested for insulting Buddhism, as bizarre as it may seem.\n\nBut of course, all of this is OK, it's Islam exclusively that's the problem, we should actively ignore *all* other acts done in the name of other religions.\n\nAm I being an apologist by saying this? No, I hate Islam as much as every right minded person. It is violent, it is authoritarian, but guess what? So is pretty much every single mainstream religion both currently, previously and in the future. Religion is a mental illness, a cancer that must be wiped from the world no matter what. It's like putting the guy who believes the voice of God is calling him to kill everyone in a secure unit whilst letting another guy who believes lamp posts wants him to kill everyone go free, even after committing acts of violence. We shouldn't be fighting religion with an exacto knife, we should be using a claymore and we shouldn't give a fuck about what part of the monster is the liver and what part is the spleen, it's all the same fucking monster. Lets kill it, bathe in it's blood and piss on it's fucking grave.\n\n&gt;The sooner you realise this the sooner we'll all be able to fix this problem.\n\nWell that last bit is ominous, What is your solution to the problem, praytell?","score_hidden":"false","archived":"false","name":"t1_cnavbk7","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1420077678","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhqb","link_id":"t3_2qy5au","parent_id":"t1_cnau609","score":"1","retrieved_on":"1425122850","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cnavbk7","subreddit":"unitedkingdom","ups":"1","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

{"body":"I'd just say find anything you enjoy doing, it doesn't have to be video games but something that brings you peace. Like I said, a lot of people say \"you SHOULD meditate\" if you feel anxious or \"you SHOULD go for a walk\" but those make me feel worse. I'd much rather fuck shit up or watch an action movie. That'll calm me down first and maybe then I'll meditate or go for a walk.\n\nBut yeah the \"shoulds\" are very bad thing to keep in your mind. I understand you feel bad about a lot of the things you \"should\" have accomplished, and maybe you \"should\" have done them, but use that as a positive to make you better in the future.\n\nWhy didn't you do the things you \"should\" have done? Should you have even done them? Are they even realistic expectations you could have fulfilled? If they are, what caused you to not them? Maybe too much pressure on yourself? Unrealistic expectations?\n\nWe're all different and anxiety is a complex motherfucker so none of us can expect to find that cure-all answer that fixes everything. What works for me at least is to ground myself first of all. I've learned that for me I can't trust anything when I'm in that anxiety/depression mindset. Seriously, the next time you're in a contemplative mindset think of you how your state of mind was after an amazing workout/or your  more calm, happier mindset and contrast that to your anxious and/or depressive mindset and try to calibrate towards your more natural state. \n\nSo find a way, anything really, that will ground you and once you feel more \"normal\" then start figuring out what you need to figure out. So if you're stressed about school, or about finding a job, don't go in with that impulsive anxious mindset. Tell that to fuck off, focus on something that will ground you, and when you're in that more stable mindset go to the next step and start tackling those in a more logical and sensible way.\n\nEdit: I tend to catch myself in those cycles when I have nothing going on. If I'm aimlessly browsing reddit or whatever that's when they start to come and grow. It's hard to do but try to catch them as they come on, and start to become aware of your feelings start to change and how your anxiety rises, and what to do to prevent that. For me, I just stay occupied. On anything. I find a new TV series to watch. I play new video games. Sometimes I'll shake up my entire routine, just so I stay out of that auto pilot. Auto pilot = thoughts, thoughts =feelings, feelings = anxiety, anxiety = loops.

{"body":"It's easy.  With a woman you have to make your intentions early on. Flirting and friendly touching. You can't just go from 0 to 100, it's too awkward. Think about it,  if you go on a first date with a girl and don't say a word to her the entire night and then go for a kiss it would be weird as hell. If you are having great convo and light touching (playful teasing,  poking her sides etc) You are essentially saying touching is in your nature and if your having fun she will most likely be into a little more. \n\nEscalating from kissing to sex is extremely easy.You never ask for sex,  that's weird. You need essentially 3 things.  Touching,  chemistry and a location. When you are at her apartment you just start making out,  then you just try to escalate with your hands.  She will let you know if you're going too  far and if she doesn't stop you she is probably wanting sex too. \n\nAs for relationships? I don't ask. In my experience, after sleeping with them 2 or 3 times they start dropping hints they want one. No strings attached sex is not all that common. \n\n","score_hidden":"false","archived":"false","name":"t1_cnavlzs","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1420078422","subreddit_id":"t5_2s4kl","link_id":"t3_2qyx07","parent_id":"t3_2qyx07","score":"13","retrieved_on":"1425122714","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cnavlzs","subreddit":"dating_advice","ups":"13","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

{"body":"Hi Guys!\n\nI've been snowboarding for almost 15 years. I'm a female about 5'9\" and cannot wait to get back on the slopes this year. But my old board that I've had for 10 years is about time for replacement. I have a K2 board (I couldn't tell you ANY details about it because I honestly have no idea). It did alright for what I needed but I always noticed tons of issues with trying to carve and with holding my edges on ice. Now I'm not an expert boarder but I can hold my own on blacks and have hiked up to the peaks in Breckenridge. I'm not really into parks or jumps or anything like that but am looking for a new good all mountain board.\n\nThe two boards I'm looking at are:\n\n* Burton [Deja Vu Flying V](http://www.burton.com/default/deja-vu-flying-v-snowboard/W15-107081.html?start=10&amp;cgid=womens-boards) \n* Rossignol [Diva Magtek](http://www.rossignol.com/US/US/diva-magtek--2014--REDWP06--product--snowboard-women-boards.html)\n\nI've already solved one of my biggest issues that occur with my super narrow long and skinny feet by getting some thirtytwo [boots](http://thirtytwo.com/boots/lashed-womens-3/white/) (best investment EVER). I cannot rave more about those boots. I had a custom fitting and they were heat molded to my feet.\n\nAnyway, the one catch up with the burton board is that I can't use any other bindings but burton bindings with it and my local shop can't order it as it's 'out of stock' for them. I've also heard awesome things about the Salomon Wonder but don't know much about it.\n\nCan you guys give me some advice? I'd really prefer a hybrid, all-mountain board. I'm not really limited as far as money goes but I'd love to keep the board under 600.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"false","name":"t1_cnavmbm","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1420078446","subreddit_id":"t5_2qi0t","link_id":"t3_2qwuty","parent_id":"t3_2qwuty","score":"1","retrieved_on":"1425122710","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cnavmbm","subreddit":"snowboarding","ups":"1","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

{"body":"Dude, I had a very similar experience. Maybe you can do some things with my advice that I couldn't. I was in a 4 yr relationship, married for less than one. We're doing the dishes and she tells me she's leaving. Lots of other bullshit and we end up getting divorced. I begged and pleaded but it didn't matter. Fast forward over 3 years and it's been tough but it's also the period of my life where I've learned the most about myself. You learn what you have to do to make yourself happy and you'll learn who your friends. The sooner you go NC, no Facebook and whatever, the better.\n\nMy ex is remarried now and just had a kid. I honestly don't feel jealousy or anything at all. It wasn't meant to be and you can get caught in the weeds and wonder why, but it doesn't matter. Keep going to the gym and hanging out with friends. A girl will come along when you're ready. As a side note, I've never had any girl react negatively to my divorce. I explained the situation and they were cool with it. I almost want to say it turns them on a bit. Weird, but true.

{"body":"Context. The guy above you said maybe they wanted a roster change because they hadn't won any tournaments. You responded with them winning CD 2.0. *They had already gotten rid of him.*\n\nThis isn't hard to figure out. Yeah, they had plenty of great games with Simbaaa, but when they kicked him, they hadn't won the tournament yet that you brought up.\n\nAnd of course it's fair to mostly right off the success. It's an entirely different form of drafting from CM, and a great deal of pro games come down to how the drafts play out. A team without competent players won't win, but it's clear that CD measures a different set of skills when it comes to how you think about the game. \n\nWe all know that Secret is good, but when we're talking about the difference between them being a top 5 team and them wanting to be the best in the world and why they would go through a roster change, it is pointless to talk about CD.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"false","name":"t1_cnavsnx","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1420078886","subreddit_id":"t5_2s580","link_id":"t3_2qxp32","parent_id":"t1_cnav17j","score":"-1","retrieved_on":"1425122629","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cnavsnx","subreddit":"DotA2","ups":"-1","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

{"body":"Lol, I don't care. either way. you don't get it. I don't think the father should be allowed to dodge paying for it wither he tries to make the woman abort OR he tries to keep the kid.\n\nYou don't get it. My Issue is that he knocked her up in the first place which was wholly avoidable. I don't  -care- that she \"has a job\" too or \"can work too\" none of those issues matter to me as it's the CHILD who has the right and if she works and takes care of her off spring because he knocked her up then he should be forced to help her by surrundering part of his check as well.\n\n\nI'm not enraged. I'm apathetic. If you knock a woman up she has the right to decide if she wants the kid and if she decides she's going to have them and you don't want them I don't care -you're paying child support. Maybe you shouldn't be messing around if you didn't want to be trapped in that situation.\n\n\"I said he shouldn't have to pay if she chooses to keep..\"\n\nYou're not hearing me.

{"body":"I don't dislike Butcher, Dresedn Files is by far the best urban fantasy I have ever read(unfortunate a genre full of junk). I judge all other urban fantasy novels by Butcher. After reading Stormfront, I bought all the other books in the series that were published and read them all over the course of a week. However Dresden Files is turning into a soap opera. Dresden's relationship with Karrin is so obviously drawn out. Every novel ends with a scene that's basically \"I love you but for one inexplicable reason or another we can't be together\". This is the kind of stuff I stopped watching tv shows to get away from. Why must every single genre be stuffed with romantic interests for the protagonist with meandering story arcs between them? That's just one excample.\n\nIt's not the job of a writer to write a biographical encyclopedia for their fictional universe. It's the main story arc that's the most important, at least for readers like me. If people are looking for a fantasy themed soap opera in literary form then that is excactly what Dresden Files is turning into. Instead if a story arc we are getting a story spaghetti bowl.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"false","name":"t1_cnaw1bo","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1420079510","subreddit_id":"t5_2smxb","link_id":"t3_2qykwu","parent_id":"t1_cnavsd0","score":"1","retrieved_on":"1425122516","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cnaw1bo","subreddit":"KingkillerChronicle","ups":"1","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

{"body":"Hi there,\n\nI've made a few games for Android devices (Not the Greatest) and often times smaller developers don't have the resources to really test every aspect of their game.\n\nI can tell you I only playthrough once or twice and fix any bugs I find but the majority of stuff will always come from users.\n\nWith thousands of different devices and people playing the game, they will have a different concept and view of the game. They will attempt to solve puzzles in different fashions that the original developer may not have thought of.\n\nBeing the developer and knowing exactly the routes that need to be taken, characters talked to, where enemies are, it's easy for them to complete tasks that some see as hard.\n\nPerhaps they may get stuck in an area that I as a game developer never went because it was a pointless area that was just scenery(stuck between a tree and a rock for example) in this case its impractical for the independent game developers to test every single aspect of every single area.\n\nSo games will usually have bugs when released, things that are hard to test are things like AI difficulty in the sense of \"hard\" or \"easy\" and these likely change as players find strategies or niches for characters that make them overpowered. This is what leads to things like nerfing.\n\nSo everything from complexity to basic bug fixes usually need some sort of end-user test. Players ALWAYS find a way to \"cheat the system\" and it often takes that dedication to playing the game the developers don't have.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"false","name":"t1_cnaw73m","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1420079924","subreddit_id":"t5_2sokd","link_id":"t3_2qyr1y","parent_id":"t3_2qyr1y","score":"8","retrieved_on":"1425122441","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cnaw73m","subreddit":"explainlikeimfive","ups":"8","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

One managed to corner him and he and the assailant fired round after round less than 10ft from each other and continued to miss until the other officer caught up and shot the guy.

{"body":"You're post reminded me of this. My grandmother gave me this on a piece of paper back in the 90's. I transcribed it for you.\n\n\n\"It is said that there are three ages of woman- youth, middle age and \"You haven't changed a bit.\" But change is the name of the game. Now consider. We were before frozen food, penicillin, polio shots, radar, credit cards and ball-point pens. For us time-sharing meant togetherness, a chip meant a piece of wood, hardware meant hardware and software wasn't even a word. We were before pantyhose and drip-dry clothes, ice-makers, dishwashers, clothes dryers, food processor and electric blankets.\n\nWe got married first and then learned to live together. How quaint can you be? We wore Peter Pan collars and thought a deep cleavage was something a butcher did to a pork chop! We were before the white wine craze, disposable diapers and the Jefferson nickel. Pizza, cheerios, frozen orange juice and instant coffee were unheard of. We thought fast food was something you ate during Lent. In our day cigarette smoking was fashionable, grass was mowed, coke was something you drank and pot was something you cooked in. We were before day-care centers, house-husbands, baby sitters, computer dating - and the term \"making out\" referred to how you did on an exam.\n\nThere were five and ten cent stores where you could buy things for five and ten cents. For just one nickel you could ride the bus, make a phone call, buy a coke or a candy bar, or buy enough postage stamps to mail a letter and two postcards. You could buy a Chevy coupe for $659.00, and gas was at an all-time low of 11 cents a gallon.\n\nWe were not before the difference between the sexes was discovered, but we were before sex changes. We just made do with what we had! We were the last generation that was so dumb as to think you needed a husband to have a baby.\n\nWe had girdles with garters, petticoats and serge bloomers for gym. We had fountain pens with bottles of real ink, stockings of real silk with seams that were never straight. We had Shakespeare, saddle shoes, and cars with rumble seats. All long gone! Unlike the remote-control dancers of today, we knew how it felt to have a partner hold you close and double dip. When Glenn Miller played \"String of Pearls\" we melted.\n\nIn the springtime of my senility, I am a misfit. I don't go for consciousness raising or sensitivity training. I don't like to jog and I don't like to pump my own gas. My idea is to walk with a man, not jog with a walkman.

{"body":"One good reason is probably liability. No airline would be willing to start providing parachutes voluntarily because of the legal ramifications. The airline would suddenly be responsible for providing *functional* parachutes, which would require regular inspections and maintenance of each parachute. The airlines would also change the standard of care, if enough airlines provided parachutes. Once the standard of care is changed, the legal expectation is that all airlines provide parachutes. If an airline didn't, it would be liable for negligence if people died in a crash and parachutes had a chance of saving them.\n\nA federal government could require parachutes on all airlines flying to and from national territory. However, the expense of imposing that would likely be huge. Not only would airlines lobby against it like mad, but then they would pass on the expense to the citizenry in higher airfares. Then the voters would get pissed at the congresspeople who made air travel so much more expensive and cumbersome.\n\nJust some thoughts, from a legal/legislative perspective.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"false","name":"t1_cnawm7n","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1420081033","subreddit_id":"t5_2sokd","link_id":"t3_2qx5b6","parent_id":"t3_2qx5b6","score":"1","retrieved_on":"1425122245","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cnawm7n","subreddit":"explainlikeimfive","ups":"1","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

UFC is only competition in the sense that they can take talent from WWE, but UFC is not a competition to WWE's profits.  \n  \nWWE does not lose any significant money to UFC.

{"body":"&gt;In economics, there seem to be base assumptions that make the math easier, but aren't strictly true. \n\nThis is unfortunately inevitable because there are essentially an unlimited number of variables involved in economic analysis and the entire purpose of using models is to isolate which variables are the most important. The concept of a model is not based on the fact that these other variables do not exist, but simply that they are less important than the ones in the model.\n\n&gt;For instance, due to basic macro-economic models, there is a base assumption that free trade is always better due to models which show that in the long term, there is less overall wealth generated.\n\nThis isn't true. The vast majority of professional economists do not argue that 100% laissez faire is the way to go in all cases. There is no shortage of economists willing to push for higher minimum wages, public healthcare systems, etc. and there is a lot of lively debate within the field regarding the \"ideal\" mixture of free markets and regulation.\n\n&gt;So then you have the logical conclusion giving money to charity indicates a lack of information. \n\nI have never heard an economist make this argument. I would wager that the typical economist would say that donating money to charity is rational if the utility derived from donating exceeds the utility derived from spending the money on something else (this is why economists use the concept of utility - to place a value on intangible things).\n\n&gt;So then you have the logical conclusion giving money to charity indicates a lack of information. \n\nI don't think this is true either. I think almost every economist would agree that just because you are intelligent doesn't mean you are going to be wealthy or successful. There is no economic model that I can think of (and feel free to point one out if you know of one) that reduces wealth and/or financial success to intelligence or access to superior information.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"false","name":"t1_cnawoog","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1420081220","subreddit_id":"t5_2w2s8","link_id":"t3_2qy3qo","parent_id":"t3_2qy3qo","score":"1","retrieved_on":"1425122213","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cnawoog","subreddit":"changemyview","ups":"1","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

{"body":"I think it symbolized Freddie's inherent animal nature among other things. It was a representation of how he sexualized those women and only saw them as objects consisting of sexual bodies. He was also drunk at the time I believe and this perception was a inside look into his ravaged cluttered and peverted mind.  \n\nStrangely enough it shows Dodd's mindset as well. As civilized and reserved as Dodd is, and as superior as he considers himself compared to Freddie (\"tame the beast\" he tells him), he too has wild sexual impulses.We also see Peggy looking worriedly at Dodd and Freddie during this dance. So the nudity feeds perfectly into Peggy jerking Dodd off in the next scene, asserting her dominance and reining in his lust -- i.e. keeping The Cause on track. She acts as steward of The Cause. It also preceeds Dodd's \"i'm in love\" speech thus the dance also symbolizes his need to be aodred. Freddie sees this and confirms what were his doubts of Dodd. That Dodd is a seducer. And he too is being seduced. But then that's a whole other disscussion regarding the homosexual overtones of the film.\n\nFurthermore. PTA represents the women as whole, not curvy or big breasted but real with flaws in their bodies and slight fluffs of fat on their legs and stomach. He wishes to show the essence of truth in beauty which is one of the recurring themes in the film. He represents this scene sort of like a dream. One half stuck in a state of wispy reality. It also helps us understand this community of people. We can see their twisted and unorthodox beliefs and way of thinking.\n","score_hidden":"false","archived":"false","name":"t1_cnawqac","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1420081345","subreddit_id":"t5_2vwxh","link_id":"t3_2qtueq","parent_id":"t1_cn9fn14","score":"3","retrieved_on":"1425122192","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cnawqac","subreddit":"WatchItForThePlot","ups":"3","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

{"body":"I think that is too narrow, too. The process a person might go through from not thinking God exists to actually believing God exists is considered to be rather profound in most religious thought. From a Vaishnava perspective, the ultimate, highest destination is for the individual to not only believe God exists, but to *love* God. Vaishnava theology teaches that although God accepts worship, it is the love of a friend, a family member, or a spouse that he prefers to have from us. The process to that type of love is more complex than the process to mere submission, awe, and subservience.\n\nAll of this is to say that the communication we are discussing isn't necessarily going to directly address the existence or non-existence of God. It may simply be one thread of a large and complex tapestry forming an individual's experience of the divine.\n\nFrom this perspective, it could be that the love between a mother and a child is also contact with the divine that, one day, may help either or both individual complete their understanding of what it means to love the divine. \n\nI think a lot of these assumptions are fundamentally entangled with an Abrahamic conception of religion. That is why I may seem to be dragging my feet and challenging assumptions in every statement you've made. In my opinion, Vaishnava theology is far more complex and developed than Abrahamic theology. But, to be able to discuss it properly, I have found I have to be careful to spot situations in which Abrahamic assumptions are getting in the way. I hope it doesn't seem irritatingly pedantic or unnecessarily argumentative. I don't mean it that way.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"false","name":"t1_cnawrpm","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1420081458","subreddit_id":"t5_2snuc","link_id":"t3_2q6ogn","parent_id":"t1_cnatex7","score":"1","retrieved_on":"1425122174","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cnawrpm","subreddit":"DebateReligion","ups":"1","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

It's simply a fact that identity has nothing whatsoever to do with how arguments are treated in professional philosophy as practiced at American and European universities.

{"body":"As I understand it, visual snow is linked to blood pressure. The head-rush/dizziness people get when they stand up too quickly, which is just temporary low blood pressure, tends too create a crazy amount of visual snow (for me anyway). Many drugs can also affect blood pressure. Stimulants tend to increase blood pressure (hypertension) whilst depressants lower it (hypotension). In my experience visual snow is at a minimum when blood pressure is at normal levels. Stress can also affect blood pressure. There isn't any substance or supplement that can stop it, it is permanently present throughout mankind. One would imagine it can be reduced by good cardiovascular health (good diet/ exercise). My best advice would be to try ignore it or avoid a lifestyle of  staring at walls and worksheets. If it's getting increasingly worse it could be a sign of a more serious problem and you should immediately contact a doctor.\n\nHow does high/low blood pressure cause visual snow? I don't know.

{"body":"Android, depending on the phone, can have a lot more bloatware.

A lot of which ran in the background and made the whole phone slower. Sure, I rooted those phones, but I shouldn't have had to.\n\nBoth iPhone and Android are bad about having things on their phones that should be able to be removed.. I'm an Android fan all the way, but iPhone simply had far less in the way of extras and stuff, IMO. I'd rather have had a  wallpapers that I couldn't delete than 20 apps that I never used running constantly and slowing my phone down.\n\nI'm not saying one is better than the other..cause that wasn't my point. Different phones suite different people. I guess my whole point was that all phones have their downsides and all phones have extra bullshit that should be able to be removed but you cant. Its not an iPhone vs Android issue - its just an issue with current phones, in general. I agree that all phones should be 100% open and there shouldn't be things like wallpapers and apps that can't be taken off.

{"body":"I signed up for both Zipcar and AutoShare this past May. I wrote to Autoshare the other day to cancel my membership with them, and ramped up my Zipcar membership to a pricier one. Autoshare has a lot of issues--I find their cars are usually lower on gas than they're supposed to be (50%) so you often have to refuel them, members return them late so you're left standing around without a car, their cars are generally much older and usually fairly dirty/smell bad, and their billing system has a lot of problems since they use a monthly invoice+interim estimates system, I prefer just be charged for my rentals immediately.\n\nZipcar has never caused me a headache with their billing, their cars are mostly very new and in great condition, never had one fail to be present when my rental started, and while I have to refuel sometimes their required minimum is 25% and members actually do their job better with this, so it's not a problem as often.\n\nVehicles--Autoshare has 2 cars within 5 minutes' walk from me, a Nissan Micra and a Mazda 3 Hatch, which aren't great, the Mazda 3 smells awful and is usually pretty filthy. Zipcar has 8--two minis, two kia rondos, a ford escape, and a hyundai sonata+elantra+genesis. These are much, much nicer cars for the most part. They are also booked less often, there being 8 rather than 2 to choose from, so it's much easier to rent one when you want even last minute. This may vary for your address, check both their websites to see car locations.\n\nPrices--this is why I preferred autoshare for a long time, but when Zipcar has 8 cars to Autoshare's 2 in a 5-minute walking range, $1/hour isn't significant enough for me to choose them. With Zipcar they have an option where if you know you're going to drive for $50+ a month, you can sign up for a $50, 75, 125, or 250 plan monthly, where that monthly \"fee\" turns into a driving credit, so you don't actually pay a \"membership fee\", just you commit to a certain amount of driving per month. This gives you a 10% discount which brings their rates closer to autoshare's. And if you aren't going to be driving for at least $50, about 5 hours, a month, I really don't think there's much point to a membership with either. Still, even without the discount, their prices are only slightly higher.\n\nCustomer service--Zipcar's phone number connects you to their general North America call centre, the people there can be a bit underinformed about things. Autoshare's customer service is based in Toronto but I've found them to be *terrible*--they're actually malicious, and have really tried to screw me over on billing/various fees on a number of occasions.\n\nI should also mention I used Zipcar in Austin, TX, USA once instead of a traditional rental and it worked great. Perfectly seamless, no difference from reserving one here, really convenient. Autoshare has no such option.\n\nSo there you go - member of both for ~7 months, just cancelled Autoshare and ramped up my membership with Zipcar. YMMV but this is how I've found it.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"false","name":"t1_cnax4m3","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1420082466","subreddit_id":"t5_2qi63","link_id":"t3_2qx2je","parent_id":"t3_2qx2je","score":"2","retrieved_on":"1425122006","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cnax4m3","subreddit":"toronto","ups":"2","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

{"body":"You may attract unwanted attention tho. The dox spam works in the raiding department but you end up with many wasted resources and nothing to defend against a vehicle army. When I detect a dox spammer I quickly build a bot factory at each expansion site, usuall 1-3 are all I need depending on the size and value of expansion. And I set the dox to patrol ONLY the expansion site and main base, effectively outnumbering any planet wide patrolling dox strolling into my guarding dox. Then I ramp up vehicle production and quickly mobilize my vehicle army to go after the spammer. Usually they never have a big standing army and is easily taken down by a decent sized army, if I cant take down the com then I destroy as much power generators as possible and try again very soon keeping up the pressure. I can even send in small dox raids as my dox start piling up in multiple areas.\n\nWhen attacking a planet my favorite method is orbital laser snipe, why attack the planet when you can wipe it clean? When going orbital after conquering a planet I immediately build 5-8 orbital factories (always more than my enemies) , set all but 1 or 2 to building fighters. It is extremely important for me to win the orbital game and that means more factories than anyone else and pouring resources i to those factories, overwelming any and all enemy resistance. The remaining 1-2 factories build advanced radar satelites and orbital lasers, the majority of newly made orbital fabbers are directed to helping these two factories. 1 radar and 2 orbital lasers is queued. All factories get support from orbital engineers, how ever many is needed. I quickly send orbital fabbers to all planets and plunk down teleports on all uninhabited planets to grab the most eco possible. With this huge orbital army and the right intel I can take down any commander not in a pelican, umbrellas do little since they dont target laser platforms automatically and the sea of fighters take most of the damage.\n\nIn the rare case of a paranoid commander in a pelican I always have 5-10 T2 and T1 vehicle factories queued up for construction. When I find one such commander I already have a T2 army and production to break most enemy defences. Failed attempts at getting a strong hold are quickly renewed because of my unlimited supply of orbital, and the pressure is kept up. I may redirect eco from orbital to strategic nukes, production and army of T2 bot fabbers teleported to enemy planet so as to build anti nukes, flak and spamming t1 air in lowest number of seconds possible.","score_hidden":"false","archived":"false","name":"t1_cnax86w","author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"downs":"0","created_utc":"1420082746","subreddit_id":"t5_2uqs0","link_id":"t3_2qxqlq","parent_id":"t1_cnaoeec","score":"3","retrieved_on":"1425121960","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cnax86w","subreddit":"planetaryannihilation","ups":"3","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\\\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**\n\n**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**\n\n**5.

{"body":"New Year's resolution. This place sucks too much of my time, and ends up stirring up too much emotion over stupid, pointless shit that doesn't even affect my life anymore.  Do I really give a shit what the hasidim are doing in a city I haven't lived in for years, and never will again? Not really, no.  Do I really care about the fumbles and gaffes of the Tumblr crowd I outgrew decades before Tumblr existed, or the fussings of people who haven't yet grown the balls to sever abusive relationships?  Nah, not so much.  People spend time on the internet and think that the things they do there are important, while on the outside *real life is going on*, and it's just barely possible that if I continue to spend time and effort here, I might actually begin to care about the silly little arrows everyone else worships so strongly.\n\nThough the personal information bit is worth noting as well, of course.  Not really a concern of mine at this time, but noteworthy nonetheless.\n\nIf you really want to hear some \"damn interesting stories\", go find 'em - they're certainly out there, and far better written, less biased, and less apocryphal, than anything I could offer.

{"body":"&gt;Yes, legalization in and of itself doesn't protect prostitutes. The same way allowing restaurants to exist doesn't protect customers from bad food. Legalization will obviously also involve standards for such establishments to exist, in addition to a regulatory agency or expanding of other agencies. I'm not saying we vote in a one-page law saying \"Prostitution is now legal.\" \n\nThis is what I'm trying to get at. Legalization will improve standards but also make things like the exploitation legitimate. I don't think enough can be done to really make prostitution ok. \n\nI think no matter what an establishment does it's not going to stop violence or unsafe sex. \nfor example the last point on this guide to being a prostitute nothing can be done to stop that, and it's one of the biggest problems. \nhttp://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/the-vice-v11n3\n\n**edit** the point I'm talking about in this article. \n ZZZZZZZZZ\nFalling asleep. This skill, otherwise known as disassociation, comes in handy. It usually sets in around hour three of sucking a rich cokehead's limp cock. The old daddy-fucked-me thing means most whores are old friends with disassociation. You can get a lot done while you're disassociating, like thinking about that girl you knew in third grade and trying to remember her name, or deciding which movies you're going to put in your queue on Netflix.\n\nSometimes you can go so far with it that you actually fall asleep, and if that happens, you're fucked in every sense of the word. You're either going to get raped without a condom or have your face punched in. The only hos I know who survived falling asleep were the ones who were with those weirdo subservient guys who want you to laugh at their small dick and then let them eat you out for half an hour. Those guys are fucking disgusting and depressing and they are about as good as whoring gets.

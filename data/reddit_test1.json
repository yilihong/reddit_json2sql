{"body":"a $30 donut event is a bourgeois rejection of the notion that tasty donuts should be 75 cents and handmade in trashy towns on the North and South shores of Eastern MA.

{"body":"&gt; I dunno. To me it looks like their adaptation wasn't really that clever or innovative. Some people found themselves at the top after years of societal progress through a combination of luck and work. Once they got there they rewrote the rulebook\n\nIn nature there isn't a panel of judges who score your adaptation based on how clever or innovative it is. \"Cleverness\" is subjective, while surviving and beating the competition isn't.\n\nThe only thing that matters is: find a local maximum of good outcomes in the conditions you find yourself in, or find a new maximum by changing your conditions (if you can). If you do that, it means you're successful in your purpose as a living being.\n\nThe latter is an appropriate strategy for alphas, and the former strategy is appropriate for everyone else. Not everyone can be an alpha, go figure. And is it arbitrary? In part. But it's still what it is.\n\nAnd if you want \"the maximum of good outcomes\" to be defined in a more inclusive way, as in \"good for my city, for my country, for my species, my planet...\", we'd need a baseline that gets us to that level of the Maslow pyramid, as a society, where personal survival isn't as fragile as it is right now - one wrong move and you're on the street.\n\nIn any case, don't blame corporations for not wanting to pay lots and lots of taxes. No one wants to pay taxes, but for most people they simply have no option. And corporations don't want to pay taxes because they, more than anyone, are privy to the political game and know how dirty it is. Why pay taxes, when you can use that money for lobbying and supporting convenient candidates? I mean, are CEOs *that* stupid? Nope. Don't blame them for taking the obvious route.\n\nIf you want to see loopholes not be exploited, you need to close the loopholes, which, again, requires global cooperation. Which isn't easy, especially as demonizing other countries remains a \"valuable\" tool for politicians, when they want to take away people's focus away from certain problems within the country. A global government would also mean giving up some control. It's like asking a toddler to give up all their toys and share. It requires a level of maturity we don't have as of yet as a society. Just look at the petty battles for control between Greece and EU.

{"body":"Notice things - basically meaning you'll stop putting every girl on a pedestal and start to look at them like an actual person, which they are. When you do that, you start to notice that the \"perfections\" they have was sort of in your head. Maybe you'll notice that the chemistry maybe wasn't perfect and you were catering to her, which makes her happy, which makes you happy, and can give you a false sense of chemistry. I know that is common. Maybe you'll notice the ultra well put together life both socially and professionally is more just talk, they're actually not as well put together as you may have thought. Maybe you stop looking so closely at how attractive they might be, physically or mentally, and start to notice that they aren't nearly as attractive as you thought. That is basically what I mean when saying pay closer detailed attention. \n\n\n\nIt's always confusing whenever a girl keeps leading you on even if they're being somewhat affectionate still. You as a person are just going to have to decide yourself how far you'll let that go. The reality is that with women, men are very much just as in control of where things might go. If you find a girl that is very pretty, touches you, kisses up on you yet sort of disappears at times, isn't trying to have sex with you but loves the fact that you two text all day and she can talk to you about allllllllll of her problems - then you have to understand and tell yourself that you're being used for attention. Want to let it keep going? Fine, no problems there but it's usually not a good idea. Sort of comes down to \"look, have some self respect and don't put yourself through that for a supposedly pretty person\".

{"body":"I think I've said this before, but the fact that Mohammed might have been a pedo, or the fact that he was a bad guy, does not disqualify him in any way from being a prophet. Some of the OT prophets seemed to do pretty questionable things themselves. \n\nThe mistake you are making is comparing Mohhamed to some old Testament happenings, instead of comparing Mohammed to Christ. Back then, they didn't have prisons, nor could they afford to. Current historical research shows that many in that time starved to death, and almost everybody was suffering from severe malnutrition (the Hebrews and surrounding tribes in particular). This context changes everything when it comes to treatment of prisoners and so on. Every day, someone you knew died back then. They lived with death very differently than we do now.  \n\nThat said, we are Christians. We follow Jesus Christ and his gospel message. We do not have to answer for things that happened a thousand years earlier, especially since the context and times were so drastically different from our own. We believe that God is just, and fair, and whatever He ordered at that time, he did for a good reason. \n\nMuslims, however, do have to answer for Mohammed, since he is set in direct opposition to Christ. They have to answer to why they have chosen to follow a belief system that mistreats women, and children, and persecutes Christians, all as a matter of course. And that is the difference between the two, between them and us. It has nothing to do with some event that happened thousands of years earlier in a culture and context as far from our own as Mercury is from the sun. They have to answer for why they choose to reject Christ's command to love your neighbor as yourself, and instead support a code that calls for one to tax their neighbor unfairly because he is a Christian, or one that calls for the burning down of his church when he decides to add a foot to it in height. They have to answer for why they choose to reject the gospel message, which is intuitively superior in all ways to Mohhamed's moral message. I hope you can catch the drift of what I am saying here. \n\nWe judge a prophet by his fruits. If you look at the fruits of Islam, they may seem rotten. You can not name a single Muslim-majority country that does not systematically persecute people of other faiths, or have laws banning or restricting possession or distribution of bibles, or things of that sort. You have to look at the fruits, if you want to see how hardy the tree is.

{"body":"For those interested, this was posted in my OP regarding the first article about CR.  I think you may have missed it, as I was looking for your input on something I would think you would be more then willing to give.  So here goes yet again:\n\nSo there seems to be a growing contingent that wants me to cover certain points in DS's history that they feel are relevant to his involvement in SC. Primarily I believe to paint a picture of his character, and to show that he has a history of being a troll as it were. Correct me if I'm wrong about that.\nNow, as I stated I would be treating him much the same as I did this article regarding CR. It would not be a fluff piece, it would not be an attack piece, it would be the facts. That being said, I believe I have a compromise.\nOne of the articles that will be written about in this series will inevitably be about the community. As I stated I wanted this to be a comprehensive guide detailing everything about this game, and those involved to assist newcomers with making a smart economic choice. One aspect of this game is obviously the community. So here is what I prupose. I will include whatever incidents you deem necissary in the article about DS. But, it will be made clear in the article itself that these are the areas that the community of this game feels needed to be addressed in regards to DS. I won't do anyone a disservice and make it anything other then what it is. What the community feels should be known.\nSo does that work for you? The only thing that I will not allow is personal attacks. They have to be documented, and provable incidents that you feel add to a better understanding of either DS or SC. So what do you say?

Please read this entire reply - we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.\n\n**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines.](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) If you are planning to submit your own music in listentothis, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit.](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) Violating these site-wide rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.\n\n**New users** should take the time to read the [listentothis introduction](/r/listentothis/wiki/reddiquette) to learn what this place is all about, and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment, but not submit music to listentothis. Keep in mind, if you haven't got anything positive to say in your comment, it's best not to say anything. Earning downvotes will block your comments, so comment wisely.\n\nNew users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit music links in listentothis. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of 50-100 submissions each day. We can't tell you what this score is. We can only tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.\n\n**If you wish to promote music in listentothis without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links.](http://www.reddit.com/advertising) These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes.

This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are however many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you, who will give you feedback and advice, even technical tips, on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.\n\n* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback\n* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback\n* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback\n* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations\n* /r/remix - share your remixes\n* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*\n* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar\n* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks\n\nThe **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources, they *will* help you become a better musician.\n\nAs you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in listentothis, and prove that you are not a spammer. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers.

{"body":"and I 100% agree with you on that. except...\n\nI do not click the sockposts. as I said in my gigantic rant of the century, I downvote, and move on, and harbor my dislike to myself. and casually let that steam go off-site. as you have seen, I usually just say these things as small quips or to you in skype or such nonsense. \n\nand no. you aren't sounding like a dick. I am literally being what you are calling me out on. a complete dick that wants this place to be a dream world. but I am doing like the real world would do. there are people who like this kind of thing. and there are people who dont and protest. when the group is small and or stupid and want to finally be heard, they get loud and say things to get their attention. it gives them a bad rep and people will hate them, but their mission was successful. to get people to know that \"hey, dont say all of plounge because there is a minority that hates it.\" will they read it all? probably not. will they recognize me as the whiny douchebag that hates socks. yes. and they will recognize its 99.99 percent. and leave me out of the statistic. \n\nthe reason I have literally came out and made such a large fuss about it is because I wasn't going to say shit on here when there isn't a place to properly open discussion. it would be like the worst thing in the world to go into every sock post and do... this. but this was a legit person asking a legit question and getting a feel for the sock liking. so I gave my position. and then I went into dick mode and started spamming it (which I really am sorry for. that went too far). and when approached about it. I stood my ground. \n\nnow if you read the extensive fonso fight I had, it seemed like a clash. \"why don't you just accept socks\" vs the dick saying \"why don't you guys go elsewhere\". a pointless fight. it went on for far too long. \n\nalso: \n\n&gt;Sorry if I sound like a dick, but I'm getting a little fed-up with you being almost violently against this, while extolling the virtues of some of your own (frankly disgusting) fetishes elsewhere (where you also denounce anything to do with feet, legs or socks).\n\nnah, perfectly fine, but what I do on that particular sub is not in direct relation to this one. there is a relation definitely, but that one has a small bit of dissonance.  one: I don't make poop and fart threads all over the place and flood it with that kind of stuff. and two: I am not exactly trying to get people to convert to watersports or farting or whatever. it's a fetish thread. I am going to talk about my fetish. if it is a thread asking about a kink, I will talk about my kink. that's what I did. and because those popped up and was the place for it, I keep it in there. sure I talk about WS on some of the other posts that aren't directly fetish related, but I actually only reply to a comment that already has the subject. I don't just run up to someone like bashi_hart and ask them if they have heard the good word about the lord and saviour farty McPeepanties. I keep that to the niche that likes it or in the place where it is asked. the sock posts can go to a similar place: PGM. \n\nso no. I will not stop whining.

{"body":"Congratulations on your success. I like your don't give a fuck attitude, because yes, it's how one becomes successful. \n\nNo, statistics aren't an excuse, but it is a fact that it's more difficult to make money these days. Costs have gone up without the accompanying wage increase. Not everyone is necessarily as capable as you are to do what you did.  \n\nTo simply make light of the difference in difficulty, and to assume that anyone can achieve the same successes as you did is poor perception on your part. \n\nFor example. I'm in medical school right now. Shit costs me $55,000/year just in tuition. In the 90's, med school was like $8,000/year or something stupid. \n\nOver 10,000 people apply for the 250 spots at my med school each year, and it keeps going up. When I tell doctors this they simply can't believe that it's gotten so competitive and expensive. They say how it was so much easier to make money 20-30 years ago. They also say how private practices are getting out competed by big hospitals that swallow up all the turf. Then they complain about how the hospital administrators micromanage their health care decisions and they get paid less than what they did in the 90s. This is a field that is still (in many people's opinion) one with some of the best income and job security. Yet, it's objectively more difficult to make money in it than it used to be. \n\nThe way your viewpoint sounds to me is that \"well maybe these doctors should use the Internet to invent something and sell it to google for a lot of money.\"\n\nAnd that type of stuff does happen. An orthopedic surgeon I know of became a millionaire overnight thanks to a new surgical device. But that's one in hundreds of thousands of doctors. The odds are that most will just continue to work their 60-80 hrs/week as clinicians, and go home to raise their family. They don't have time to make extra money or invent things.

{"body":"The writer is dead-on when he points out that white American women have it better than any other class of humans has ever had it, in the history of existence. Where he falls short is by failing to either recognize or admit that white American men of the baby-boomer generation are ultimately responsible for allowing their female contemporaries to emasculate them. \n\nAs I see it, the weaker, effeminate, self-identifying hippie men of the 60s and 70s at some point became subconsciously aware of the fact that they were not sexually attractive to women. However, being opportunistic and generally of higher intelligence, they realized that they could garner female attention by giving them whatever they wanted. Meanwhile, those men who possessed characteristics typically associated with the ideal sexual partner were busy being killed in Vietnam. Essentially, the pussies who stayed home and took drugs chose to sand-bag the traditional men in an effort to increase their own level of desirability toward women. \n\nThose same men, of course, were not dead or suffering from PTSD so they later continued on to become politicians and lawmakers. Consequently, they could rationalize their pandering and patheticness under the guise of legality and fairness. All these years later, like with so many other things, the proverbial chickens have come to roost, and my generation is paying the price for the hippies' stupid bullshit. Now, innocent men are going to prison and soon men in the armed forces will be killed because a woman in a combat position had lower standard requirements. \n\nAlso, i think the author is wrongly characterizing the notion that all women who make false rape accusations are doing it with malice. What I think, is often times these women honestly believe they were raped, but they're wrong. Most are incapable of accepting the consequences of their behavior, thus they internalize and genuinely believe they were raped when they weren't. That's why the SJW's battle cry of, \"why would a woman lie about being raped?\" seems to be a trump card. Whenever I get this response to the questioned veracity of a rape claim, I always respond by explaining that I don't think she's lying.  I think she's just wrong. Despite what women would like us to believe, rape is not a black and white crime - especially among acquaintances when the criminally accused's defense is consent. I personally have twice defended men in a court of law who were accused of committing a rape and the supposed victim was literally unaware she'd been raped until a male friend of her's suggested she was. The old sand-bagger couldn't cope with the jealousy stemming from the fact that she, the \"victim,\" had consensual sex with a man other than himself, so he tells her she was raped in an effort - an insane and perverted effort - to ultimately reap sexual benefits from the woman as an expression of her gratitude for him being the only honest man in the world. Faggots.

{"body":"\"WASHINGTON\u2014Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose liberal call to action has propelled his long-shot presidential campaign, is proposing an array of new programs that would amount to the largest peacetime expansion of government in modern American history.\nIn all, he backs at least $18 trillion in new spending over a decade, according to a tally by The Wall Street Journal, a sum that alarms conservatives and gives even many Democrats pause. Mr. Sanders sees the money as going to essential government services at a time of increasing strain on the middle class.\nHis agenda includes an estimated $15 trillion for a government-run health-care program that covers every American, plus large sums to rebuild roads and bridges, expand Social Security and make tuition free at public colleges.\nTo pay for it, Mr. Sanders, a Vermont independent running for the Democratic nomination, has so far detailed tax increases that could bring in as much as $6.5 trillion over 10 years, according to his staff.\nA campaign aide said additional tax proposals would be offered to offset the cost of some, and possibly all, of his health program. A Democratic proposal for such a \u201csingle-payer\u201d health plan, now in Congress, would be funded in part through a new payroll tax on employers and workers, with the trade-off being that employers would no longer have to pay for or arrange their workers\u2019 insurance.\nMr. Sanders declined a request for an interview. His campaign referred questions to Warren Gunnels, his policy director, who said the programs would address an array of problems. \u201cSen. Sanders\u2019s agenda does cost money,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at the problems that are out there, it\u2019s very reasonable.\u201d\nCalling himself a democratic socialist, Mr. Sanders has long stood to the left of the Democratic Party, and at first he was dismissed as little more than a liberal gadfly to the party\u2019s front-runner, Hillary Clinton. But he is ahead of or tied with the former secretary of state in the early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, and he has gained in national polling. He stands as her most serious challenger for the Democratic nomination.\nMr. Sanders has filled arenas with thousands of supporters, where he thunders an unabashedly liberal agenda to tackle pervasive economic inequality through more government services, higher taxes on the wealthy and new constraints on banks and corporations.\nCapital Journal: Iran Nuclear Deal Lands In the Middle of 2016 Debate \u201cOne of the demands of my campaign is that we think big and not small,\u201d he said in a recent speech to the Democratic National Committee.\nEnacting his program would be difficult, if not impossible, given that Republican control of the House appears secure for the foreseeable future. Some of his program would be too liberal for even some centrist Democrats. Still, his agenda articulates the goals of many liberals and is exerting a leftward pressure on the party\u2019s 2016 field.\nThe Sanders program amounts to increasing total federal spending by about one-third\u2014to a projected $68 trillion or so over 10 years.\nFor many years, government spending has equaled about 20% of gross domestic product annually; his proposals would increase that to about 30% in their first year. As a share of the economy, that would represent a bigger increase in government spending than the New Deal or Great Society and is surpassed in modern history only by the World War II military buildup.\nBy way of comparison, the 2009 economic stimulus program was estimated at $787 billion when it passed Congress, and President George W. Bush\u2019s 2001 tax cuts were estimated to cost the federal treasury $1.35 trillion over 10 years.\nMrs. Clinton so far has proposed programs that together would cost an estimated $650 billion over 10 years. Her college-affordability plan is estimated at $350 billion over 10 years, and an expected child-care proposal is estimated to cost at least $200 billion. Those are modest sums next to Mr. Sanders\u2019s agenda.\nHe proposes $1 trillion to repair roads, bridges and airports. His college-affordability program would cost $750 billion over a decade. Smaller programs would provide youth jobs and prevent cuts to private pension plans. He would raise an additional $1.2 trillion in Social Security taxes in order to increase benefits and pay those already promised for 50 years. That would bolster the program but fall short of the 75 years of solvency that is typically what policy makers aim to achieve.\nMr. Sanders says he also would propose an expansion of federal support for child care and preschool, though he hasn\u2019t said how much those programs would cost, and they aren\u2019t included in this total.\nHis most expensive proposal, by far, is his plan to extend Medicare, the federal health program for seniors, to all Americans.\nMr. Sanders hasn\u2019t released a detailed plan, but a similar proposal in Congress, sponsored by Rep. John Conyers (D., Mich.), would require $15 trillion in federal spending over 10 years, on top of existing federal health spending, according to an analysis of the plan by Gerald Friedman, an economist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. Mr. Conyers\u2019s office referred questions about the plan to Mr. Friedman.\nMr. Gunnels, the Sanders aide, said the campaign hasn\u2019t worked out all details on his plan\u2014for instance, his version might allow each state to run its own single-payer system. But he said the $15 trillion figure was a fair estimate.\nSingle-payer health care has long been on the liberal wish list, but it has never had sufficient support in Congress. Proponents say it is the best way to guarantee coverage to every American\u2014something that the Affordable Care Act falls short of\u2014and lower overall costs.\nThe Conyers plan, for instance, assumes significant savings by allowing the government to negotiate for prescription-drug prices, and it would rely on the new payroll taxes for funding.\nMr. Sanders and some Democrats see the 2010 health law as a good first step, but they say more needs to be done. Many other Democrats, scarred from the fight over the ACA and seeing it as a major step forward, are ready to move on to other issues.\nSo far, the tax increases Mr. Sanders has proposed are concentrated on Americans earning at least $250,000 a year and on corporations. They include increases in the capital-gains tax, the estate tax and personal income-tax rates for the wealthiest Americans. He also would impose a fee on financial transactions, with investment companies taxed on every stock they trade.\nTaken together, these proposals are attractive to many Democrats, said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, and would transform the U.S. into an economy much more like those in Europe, with a significantly larger share of economic activity in government hands. \u201cIt\u2019s not the model we employ [in the U.S.], but it is a viable economic model,\u201d he said. Still, he cautioned the revenue would have to come from the middle class as well as the wealthy.\nMore-centrist Democrats think it is a bad idea. \u201cWe are not a country that has limitless resources. You need to tamp on the brakes somewhere, but he doesn\u2019t,\u201d said Jim Kessler, senior vice president for policy at the Democratic think tank Third Way. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as free college; somebody is going to be paying for it.\u201d\nConservative economists say higher government spending would hurt long-term economic growth and that this much would stunt it altogether. \u201cIf we\u2019re putting our resources into government, that\u2019s a place where you\u2019re not going to get productivity gains,\u201d said Kevin Hassett, an American Enterprise Institute analyst who has advised many GOP presidential candidates but is unaffiliated this year. Mr. Hassett said the tax increases required to pay for the Sanders program would be \u201cmassively catastrophic.\u201d\nEven many Democrats say such a plan would be politically infeasible. Austan Goolsbee, an economist at the University of Chicago and former adviser to President Barack Obama, recalled the difficulty winning congressional approval for the stimulus and health legislation at a time of large Democratic majorities in Congress.\n\u201cMuch, much more modest actions than those Bernie Sanders is describing were extremely heavy lifts, and many thought impossible,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth of them came down to a single vote.\u201d\nWrite to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.com","score_hidden":null,"archived":null,"name":null,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"downs":null,"created_utc":"1442344533","subreddit_id":"t5_2cneq","link_id":"t3_3l2src","parent_id":"t1_cv2niuf","score":"2","retrieved_on":"1444380729","controversiality":"1","gilded":"0","id":"cv2nkkq","subreddit":"politics","ups":"2","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

{"body":"I've been on and off suicidal for about 5 years. I've had quite a few attempts, usually one every six months or so. I sometimes self harm and I drink an unhealthy amount of alcohol every night. I also find it hard to leave my bed and would prefer to stay in my bedroom than go outside, or even to my kitchen or living room. I have self esteem and weight issues in regards to this too.\n\nI once self harmed so bad I was bleeding profusely. Despite this, I bandaged it up myself but unfortunately had an allergic reaction to the anti septic, therefore ironically scarring my arm badly while leaving it infected to the point where I needed strong antibiotics.\n\nI was honest with the staff and told them at the hospital when I went in to get treated, and to their credit, they honestly did care and handled it very professionally.\n\nThat said, once they referred me to the mental health unit, nothing really was done other than \"go so a councillor at school,\" of which there was only two weeks of school left until I left for university.\n\nTime and time again I go to get help, and they just let me fall through the cracks. By now I've learnt to just not bother, because I'm not legible for medication or therapy, so why would I just go to a psychiatrist just for them to tell me to see a school councillor?\n\nI don't even think we had one to be honest, we had a nurse but I didn't know her and trust her, nothing on her, but I wasn't comfortable opening up to a person associated with school. Anyways it was too late to do anything about it anyways.\n\nIf you have a mental health problem, you're on your own. That's what the NHS has taught me at least.","score_hidden":null,"archived":null,"name":null,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"downs":null,"created_utc":"1441445639","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhqb","link_id":"t3_3jmhn5","parent_id":"t3_3jmhn5","score":"1","retrieved_on":"1444183802","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"curdrzo","subreddit":"unitedkingdom","ups":"1","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

{"body":"\"How am I supposed to do that?\" I ask, sitting down on a white rock. The clearing was an interesting choice. I didn't know if Death chose this place for all the newly deceased or if it held some deep symbolism. I didn't feel a connection, so perhaps it was neutral. \n\nDeath didn't look like I expected. The cloaked skeleton must have been a Western ideal. Death was a young man with long brown hair. He wore clothing I remembered from my childhood, the 'gnarly nineties'. He wore a white shirt, covered by a jean jacket. His jeans had a dragon patch on the leg. His shoes were black and white Chucks. \n\nThis was meant to speak to me, or Death had terrible taste in fashion. \n\nPerhaps it was someone I once trusted or should have met. Was my guardian angel an extra from Pete and Pete? \n\nHe said his name was 'Grimm' and he was here to guide me. He said to move passed the White Rock, I needed to evaluate who I was and where I came from. 29 years of mistakes, whittled down to tooth picks of contemplation. \n\n\"How am I supposed to do that?\" I asked again. \n\nGrimm didn't seem to have an idea. He said people just started talking. Usually they talked until the door appeared and wouldn't stop until he shoved them through. \n\n\"I don't really work like that,\" I said. \"I am rather content with the way my life went. I watched a lot of TV. I had good friends. I had a few adorable pets. I guess it doesn't matter to me. Won't I forget it when I die?\" \n\nGrimm seemed perplexed. \"You're telling me you don't have regrets?\" \n\n\"Oh, I do. I was a fat fuck,\" I said. \"I should have found love sooner. But what does it matter now? Do we reincarnate or do I have to go to some other waiting room?\" \n\nI looked around. I wasn't trying to be annoying. I just didn't think I needed to explain myself. \n\nGrimm tugged on his shirt hem. He didn't seem to understand what I was saying. \"I need you to talk about your life.\" \n\n\"But what does it do? What is the end game?\" I demanded. \n\n\"You feel better.\" \n\n\"But I don't want to feel better. I am fine the way I am.\" I crossed my arms over my chest. \"And it's rude. I know you're fake. You don't want to know about me, genuinely. You are doing it as a job. It's creepy.\" \n\nDeath didn't seem to comprehend what I was saying. \"I want to hear because...\" \n\n\"It's your *job.*\" I stood up, stretching my legs. \"How do you really look?\" \n\nGrimm worked his angular jaw. He pulled on his jacket, adjusted his pants, like they didn't fit right. He moved past me, to sit on the rock himself. \n\nI moved passed him to the almost black river, running through the gray earth. I saw myself, dressed for the first day of middle school. I had been 12. It was the first outfit my mom let me pick: black leggings and a floral dress. I had put a baggy black sweatshirt over the Sunday dress and added oversize Doc Martins I stole from my sister. \n\nMy hair, cut into a style I hated, hung in my eyes, red and uneven. \n\n\"Is this when I was the happiest?\" I asked. \n\n\"Usually people take the form that feels most natural to them. Usually when they realized they were... their own person.\" Grimm was hunched over. \n\n\"When were you happiest?\" I asked. \n\nThere was a choked sound, like someone swallowing wrong. Then a ripping. When I looked back at death, he was replaced by a small, thin woman. She wore her hair in a complicated braid. She looked sun beaten and weather worn, her hands larger than her frame would suggest. She had a small bust but thick hips. \n\nHer face looked surprised. She wasn't pretty and her teeth were chipped away. But she was at home in the body, shocked by the new change. \n\n\"I haven't been happy in a long time.\" \n\nA sound like chimes in the wind drifted through the clearing. Grimm stood up and walked towards a white door. Then, with only a smile, she was gone. \n\nSighing, I looked around the clearing. It was boring. I would have rather been back on earth. Another door, this time blue, appeared beside me. \n\nAs I walked through, I was met with the smell of fish. I was in an office. Behind the large desk sat a lion. \n\n\"Welcome to Heaven's Gate, I am Lord Leo. Yes, Zodiac sign. I have heard you applied for our job of Soul Tour Guide.\" \n\n\"I didn't, but Grimm walked through the white door,\" I said. \n\n\"That means you are now our new Grimm Reaper.\" \n\n\"Okay.\" \n\n\"Let me explain what you need to do.\" ","score_hidden":null,"archived":null,"name":null,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"downs":null,"created_utc":"1441197610","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","link_id":"t3_3jbub9","parent_id":"t3_3jbub9","score":"1","retrieved_on":"1444126546","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cuo29y7","subreddit":"WritingPrompts","ups":"1","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

He can't make anyone miss and often runs these banana, snake like routes. he has very little lateral movement. look at his highlights, and see how many times he has one man to beat, but simply can't make the move to get to the next level.\n\nthis is all coming from a guy who was very high on murray until about 2 weeks ago. when i started to look at his runs very closely.\n\ndont get me wrong, he has all the physical gifts to be an amazing rb, but something hasn't clicked for him. he not only doesn't have that beast mode instinct, he also lacks any real foot speed.\n\nI think those factors add up to him being a very matchup dependent starter. those darfting him early in the 2nd hoping for an rb1 are going to be disappointed.\n\nI play in a 14 man keeper league, and I rather reach for tj yeldon, todd gurley and ameer abdullah instead of take murray in like the 3rd round.\n\nyeldon and gurley are potential every down backs and abdullah is very talented. all of them can make guys miss in the open field, and gurley and yeldon have bodies to become plowers.\n\nthe acl injury to gurley doesn't worry me at all after watching AP, and charles and more players come back form knee injuries. we live in a time where the knee injuries are not career ending injuries at all.\n\nim drunk, and im done. peace.","score_hidden":null,"archived":null,"name":null,"author":"JulianAkaBean","author_flair_text":null,"downs":null,"created_utc":"1441180089","subreddit_id":"t5_2qlqq","link_id":"t3_3jb2sn","parent_id":"t1_cunucwk","score":"6","retrieved_on":"1444124424","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cunxrug","subreddit":"fantasyfootball","ups":"6","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

I wasn't swimming in offers, that isn't how it works.

{"body":"&gt;I probably would have chuckled, had I not heard some variation of this joke 500+ times in my life.\n\nThis is something most of the reddit \"comedians\" will never experience, and is why they can't understand someone disliking their jokes. When you're a straight, white male, you really don't have to worry about hearing the same joke regarding your gender and orientation being told to you a dozen times every day. The worst you get is cast as a fat buffoon husband in a sitcom, but you're also cast as the clever, hot sex magnet, and the fat buffoon husband still gets a hot wife so it's a fair trade. \n\nGoing on the internet when you're straight, white, and male, you're pretty much protected by precedent from having jokes made at your expense, and you're surrounded by billions of people who will defend you if someone dare make a joke you don't approve of. \n\nGoing on the internet when you're anything other than straight, white, and male, you've got billions of people telling the same jokes about every aspect of your being every day, and speaking up against those jokes paints a giant target on your back. \n\nLook at GamerGate, for example: A woman writes an article saying the stereotypical gamer doesn't have to be the core audience anymore because gaming is mainstream, and she has the lowest peons all the way to the Total Biscuits looking for blood to be spilt. But GamerGate pushes out \"le happy merchant\" propaganda to stereotype and attack someone for being jewish (who isn't jewish, as far as I know), intentionally misgenders multiple people, and spreads bullshit claiming a transwoman is a pedophile and has sex with animals...and literally nothing has happened to them. Anyone calling them out gets swarmed, doxxed, and SWAT summoned upon their homes. \n\nRedditors will never understand what it's like to have their very identity be the butt of a thousand jokes they're forced to see every day, and they've got an entire internet of people ready to make sure that never happens.","score_hidden":null,"archived":null,"name":null,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"downs":null,"created_utc":"1441318888","subreddit_id":"t5_2s4m9","link_id":"t3_3jjjzs","parent_id":"t3_3jjjzs","score":"43","retrieved_on":"1444156112","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cuprwov","subreddit":"ShitRedditSays","ups":"43","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

{"body":"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.\n\nPeople on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.\n\nThe first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.\n\nLikely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.\n\nAnd because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up \"true          shooting percentage\" or \"win shares\" I know they know nothing about basketball.\n\nKobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.\n\nSo when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.\n\nYou might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.\n\nThis sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.\n\nSo don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your \"greats\" like ~~LeBron James~~ The Best Player in the World\u2122, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?\n \n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

{"body":"Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.\n\n**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.\n\n**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. \n\nNew users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.\n\n**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*\n\nIf you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).\n\n**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.\n\n* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      \n* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback\n* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback\n* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback\n* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  \n* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations\n* /r/remix - share your remixes\n* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*\n\nThe **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.\n\nAs you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!\n\n[permalink](http://reddit.com/r/Music/comments/3j8blu/domino_is_giving_a_blowjob_to_brandon_iron_and/)\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

{"body":"&gt;People see trolls, bandwagoners and a couple of cocky people and pretend the whole fanbase is acting out\n\nI recognize that this happens, but I'm honestly looking at this from a different perspective. For me, the most obnoxious fanbase is the fanbase that tends to get the most obnoxious outliers. A whole fanbase is rarely one thing or another, but many things at once.\n\nFor instance, after IEM I saw a sharp increase in cocky TSM outliers. If I then say \"jeez, TSM sure have a cocky fanbase\" what I'm hyperbolically saying - and quite unfairly saying, granted - is that TSM (at that moment) have more cocky outliers than any other fanbase. They are then labelled the most obnoxious fanbase.\n\nIf I say Fnatic fans are all a bunch of cockmunchers what I'm really saying is that post-MSI Fnatic brought out cockmunching behaviour in the few vocal idiots *within* that very wide fanbase. The expectation there is that actual sane Fnatic fans that aren't locking into the assumption that they'll win the entire WC will recognize \"oh, I'm not a cockmuncher. Guess he's not talking about me.\" and go on with their day. \n\nTruth is, within EU I support Fnatic and within NA I support CLG.

{"body":"Because it's a text written by multiple authors over hundreds of years, that was translated from Hebrew to Greek to Latin to English before it reached you. It's describing what happened back then, not saying that this is the true \"one woman / one man marriage\" that Paul describes 500 - 700 years after those Old Testament texts.\n\nIt's more helpful I think to look at the Bible as a path to communion with God rather than a dogma that you'll be punished for disobeying. Its been more helpful to me to at it as \"God loves me and is trying to save me from an inherently fucked up world by suggesting these behaviors\" rather than \"God hates me because I've sinned and is trying to punish me\". \n\nGiven my own experience with polygamy (or more appropriately polyamorous relationships), long before my conversion and marriage, even in situations where it was accepted by all parties, it led to a level of discord and unhappiness that was extremely destructive for all involved. Even the \"good\" times felt hollow and empty.\n\nIn comparison, while my marriage hasn't been perfect, after my conversion my relationship with my wife has proven to be a path to God - an experience of unity and love that re-affirms my faith and my thankfulness for all that God has blessed me with.\n\nSo yes, these men were married to more than one woman back in the Old Testament days and it was readily accepted. A few hundred years later, Paul writes in Corinthians that being married to only one woman brings one closer to God. \n\nIn my own experience, I've found him to be right.\n\nTo provide you greater context, the two Corinthians chapters are letters that Paul wrote to the church at Corinth, which was a Greek city equivalent to Las Vegas today - lots of temple prostitutes, sexual immorality, debauchery, etc. This new church at Corinth was right in the middle of all that craziness, and Paul was trying to help them manage the influences around them and still be good Christians.\n","score_hidden":null,"archived":null,"name":null,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"downs":null,"created_utc":"1441231915","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh6c","link_id":"t3_3jeeoe","parent_id":"t1_cuom3b3","score":"1","retrieved_on":"1444136552","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cuon3ex","subreddit":"Christianity","ups":"1","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

{"body":"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.\n\nPeople on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.\n\nThe first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.\n\nLikely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.\n\nAnd because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up \"true          shooting percentage\" or \"win shares\" I know they know nothing about basketball.\n\nKobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.\n\nSo when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.\n\nYou might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.\n\nThis sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.\n\nSo don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your \"greats\" like ~~LeBron James~~ The Best Player in the World\u2122, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?\n \n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Furthermore, I believe that this attitude does a disservice to both the people you're speaking with and to the forum you're attempting to create.\n\nIf people are repeating the same replies to you over and over again, then it seems to me that either they're not interested in listening to your position in the first place (their loss), or you may need to do a better job at presenting your position, as well as your knowledge.\n\nAddressing counter arguments first in the body of your argument is essential to fostering a constructive discussion. I believe that it not only helps to improve the way your readers see you but that it also gives the reader insight into your level of study and authority on the subject matter, which can expedite discussions tremendously. \n\nI'm sure there are also people who overlook portions of your argument out of laziness, but I feel that the point at which you can categorize these replies as inevitable is the point at which you should reexamine how you approach your own argumentative organization and style.","score_hidden":null,"archived":null,"name":null,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"downs":null,"created_utc":"1443508257","subreddit_id":"t5_2qi4f","link_id":"t3_3mqk5t","parent_id":"t1_cvhkg75","score":"2","retrieved_on":"1444645264","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cvhudbc","subreddit":"Catholicism","ups":"2","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

{"body":"I'm on your side man, I'm completely with you. \n\nFortunately you didn't have situations in Vienna when 3-5000people started to riot that they want to go to Germany _immediately_, but that time will also come. The refugee camps are not designed to receive 140.000people/year in Hungary. When other countries like UK and France (population 50-60M+) says they _can_ receive 20.000 refugees in 5 years, you also have to take into consideration that the Hungarian government is trying to keep them in Hungary and register them (in a 9M country). But 2000 policemen cannot force register 4000new refugees/day, while the masses don't want themselves to be registered. That's why they are protesting and marching on the motorway towards Germany. Don't you think if police collect them and force put them into camps that would put all the NGOs on fire?\n\nAlso currently there is no physical and legal way to stop these people as everybody claims they are asylum seekers and you have to let them in. Not just Hungary, but Austria as well. If you are not letting in an asylum seeker (currently) you are breaking international laws. That's why the Hungarian government decided to build a wall that will funnel the masses to the legal border crossing (ideally), so at least they can register them, and check whether they have right to enter the EU. That's the case in France and Italy as well, although a not that tall (compared to Spain) wall in Hungary is against humanity, and got immediate criticism from France (who is also building a wall). \n\nEven if \u00d6BB stops the trains, these people will cross the border by foot (Hegyeshalom). You cannot stop them, nobody can stop them, no legal way at the moment. That's why i'm saying they -as asylum seekers- currently have more rights (on this field) than you or me, european citizens. Frankly i don't want to be in their shoes, so i'm okay not having these rights. I'm just saying this is not good, and blaming each other won't help solve the problem (not here, here it is fine, but on higher level). I wish there could be an honest communication that would consider the existing populations' rights as well, not just the newcomers' rights. This is a fucked up situation, i have also no solutions. Just would suggest more empathy and support for not just towards the refugees but towards each other as well. You can easily blame somebody who has 20x more refugees than your country currently. Hungary could also blame Greece that that was their first entry point in the EU, they will just deport everybody back there. Although they see it is not a solution. If you bring them back to Greece, they will march to Germany/Sweden from there. Everybody is overloaded, if you are reading local news in Austria you know that. \n\nTo better understand what happened in Hungary when they started to protest in Keleti, this is a good summary: https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3jxy8p/austria_to_close_borders_to_refugees_again/cuta7ws\n\nPeace.","score_hidden":null,"archived":null,"name":null,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"downs":null,"created_utc":"1441915435","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh4j","link_id":"t3_3kdw8e","parent_id":"t1_cux3224","score":"6","retrieved_on":"1444284608","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cux47rj","subreddit":"europe","ups":"6","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

{"body":"Your post has been automatically removed by this bot because your title is incorrect.\n\n**Trading Items.** Your title must appear like this: [H] Item or items you have [W] Item or items wanted\n\nThe full details of the trade are not required to be in the title, but if not they must be in the description. However, you must say what you are willing to accept as an offer in your title. For example, \"[H] Sandman [W] Offers\" is inappropriate. However, \"[H] Sandman [W] Offers in Metal/Keys/Promos\" is acceptable as long as a specific price is listed in the trade description.\n\nIf you are selling more than 5 items, you can instead use the [Store] tag. Note that all relevant trade info still needs to be within the post without requiring the user to view an external site. Simply linking to a pricing spreadsheet site or a different trade site to sell your items is not sufficient by itself to meet the pricing rule.\n\n**Other types of appropriate titles.** You may also use the following tags for *non-trade* posts.\n\n1. [PC] - Asking for a price check on an item.\n2. [Q] - Asking a trading-related question.\n3. [PSA] - Public service announcements of great community importance.\n4. [Raffle] - If you intend on doing a free raffle (raffles with any sort of buy-in are prohibited).\n5. [Contest] - If you are holding a contest to give away free things.\n6. [Free], [Giveaway] - If you are giving something away for free, you can use either one of these tags.\n\n**Tag Formatting.** The tag used must start the post title, and some text after the tag is required. Extraneous text within tag brackets will cause the post to be removed. For trade posts, [H] must start the title (come before [W]).\n\n**Scammers.** If you are attempting to report a scammer on our game servers, please review [this post](http://redd.it/mbpbg) and follow the process within it. If the scammer originated from our subreddit instead, please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftf2trade). If the scammer is not related to our community, please direct your report to [SteamRep](http://forums.steamrep.com/forums/report/). Unfortunately with the ubiquity of scammer accounts, [PSA] posts warning about specific scammers are not permitted here. \n\n***\n\n**If you have not already, PLEASE review the rules of /r/tf2trade by clicking [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/wiki/rules).**\n\nImportant rules to remember are that prices are required for all items (Rule 10), and to limit your posting of trades ([H]/[W] or [Store]) to one trade per 12 hour period regardless of whether any other trade is closed or deleted (Rule 11).\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

{"body":"&gt; The way SQL is designed completely eliminates composition, it also is a great hindrance to code suggestions.\n\nIf I understand what you mean by \"composable\" here, that's not up to how SQL is designed. It's up to what individual vendors support. Look up MULTISET, for example. It allows for very rich query &amp; result-set composition.\n\n&gt; For instance, why can't I make make a base-query, store it as a variable and then make alterations to it to fit my need?\n\nYou can, it's called \"compound statements\" or the various dialects of it, like Microsoft's T-SQL.\n\n&gt; A common problem which is really complicated and tedious in SQL which people encounter all the time is creating a report and then wanting to add a line which is the sum at the end or beginning.\n\nI'm not sure I fully understand the example, but it seems to me you either want the sum, or you want the individual numbers that make up the sum.\n\nIf you ask for the individual numbers, it's easy to compute the sum locally at the client, there's no purpose to making SQL do the job twice and then send redundant data over the wire (typically SQL data is sent over a named pipe or TCP, not always, of course, case in point this JS API, SQLite etc.).\n\n&gt; without having to do what many SQL developers are doing today; start with SELECT * FROM and then go back to the * after they have populated the WHERE and JOIN clauses.\n\nI don't know, I just write it in order. Given most SQL is sent from a programming language, autocomplete would really involve a lot deeper integration between language, IDE and SQL than I think you're willing to admit.\n\nWhat you say may be true when writing SQL directly against the database in some visual database tool, but the subject of this thread is a JS API. Whatever you use for your JS writing, chances are it doesn't see your database tables and columns. If it would, allowing from().select() would be a very trivial update to the API.\n\nAnother approach to autocompletion is code generation based on your SQL schema. But then you're in full control of the resulting JS (or whatever language) API and what SQL does is irrelevant.","score_hidden":null,"archived":null,"name":null,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"downs":null,"created_utc":"1442301224","subreddit_id":"t5_2fwo","link_id":"t3_3kvlqk","parent_id":"t1_cv23vbb","score":"1","retrieved_on":"1444371482","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cv248im","subreddit":"programming","ups":"1","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

Anyone on the other team can grab the ball after it is punted, but anyone *behind the kicker* can grab it as well.\n\n3.

If you want to move forward with an offer, they direct you to the agent that is in charge of their team.  The head agent has closed on dozens and dozens of homes.\n* You can interact with the agent at any time if you wish, but you really don't need to, as the staff was very helpful.\n* My agent used to run his own office, but liked the Redfin approach.  More selling/closing and less managing an office &amp; business.\n* The theory is, make the customers happy and the serious buyers will ultimately buy with you.\n* The web site is extremely well done and up to date.

You do not have to use them, but it makes the process go smoother / cheaper.\n* My agent told me to walk from a house or two.  It felt like the equivalent of a car dealer telling me I shouldn't buy a car today.  He said the house wasn't what I wanted and he told me why, and I agreed.  I valued his honesty.\n* Never for a moment did I feel like he was pressuring me to buy something or cave in the negotiation process to speed things along.  So either he didn't do it, or was extremely good at it.\n* The efficiencies of their operation afford them the ability to issue that 15% rebate of the buyer agent's commission.  Knowing they were going to chip in $1200 to the purchase was icing on the cake.\n","score_hidden":null,"archived":null,"name":null,"author":"midnitewarrior","author_flair_text":null,"downs":null,"created_utc":"1442373617","subreddit_id":"t5_2qipl","link_id":"t3_3l31uc","parent_id":"t3_3l31uc","score":"7","retrieved_on":"1444389021","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cv350lo","subreddit":"RealEstate","ups":"7","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.\n\n**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*\n\nIf you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).\n\n**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.\n\n* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      \n* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback\n* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback\n* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback\n* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  \n* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations\n* /r/remix - share your remixes\n* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*\n\nThe **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.\n\nAs you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!\n\n[permalink](https://reddit.com/r/Music/comments/3mwejn/krk_rokit_rp5_g3_powerelectricity_question/)\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Why not have a table for your entity *types*, so you can add entity *types* to the database without adding new tables.\n\nSame idea, right?\n\n&gt; Searching through the PHP/Ruby/C# etc for something like \"LEGO\" or \"Atlanta\" or \"Magenta\" shouldn't find anything.\n\nI'll extend this again: searching through your code for something like \"users\" or \"user_id\" shouldn't reveal anything, all your entities and their fields can be configured dynamically through the database. \n\nSome apps do that. But why don't *you* do that? Because... you know that some data is stable, and some data is less stable. So you can choose what to make static and what to make configurable.\n\nFor every thing you make configurable, you add complexity to your code, and you add pointless roundtrips to the database which don't contribute any value. So don't draw the line arbitrarily, decide depending on project needs, or in other words, to repeat your quote...\n\n&gt; Searching through the PHP/Ruby/C# etc for something like \"LEGO\" or \"Atlanta\" or \"Magenta\" shouldn't find anything.\n\n...your \"should\" here is defined by the needs of your clients/boss/stakeholders/company/whatever. Without being able to identify their needs for a specific project (and when speaking in general, *we can't*), we can't discuss what \"should\" or what \"shouldn't\".","score_hidden":null,"archived":null,"name":null,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"downs":null,"created_utc":"1443195116","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh38","link_id":"t3_3m943z","parent_id":"t1_cvdr0p9","score":"2","retrieved_on":"1444576062","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cvdtrow","subreddit":"PHP","ups":"2","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

{"body":"Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.\n\n**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.\n\n**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. \n\nNew users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.\n\n**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*\n\nIf you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).\n\n**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.\n\n* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      \n* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback\n* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback\n* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback\n* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  \n* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations\n* /r/remix - share your remixes\n* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*\n\nThe **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.\n\nAs you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it.

{"body":"&gt; Here we are talking about storing request data in the object that represents the request.\n\nYou're implying an overly broad, meaningless definition, where absolutely everything in PHP can be described as \"request data\" as the entire PHP environment was set up in response to a specific incoming request, and it \"represents the request\".\n\nA language negotiated against application state (supported languages) is not request data. It's application data.\n\n*The request already comes with everything that's in the request*, by definition. Anything else derived through it via custom logic, or using application state, is part of the application, unless it transforms the request into another raw request, which is the point of middleware: every link should be able to take from any point in the chain, and see a normal, raw HTTP request. Not \"enhanced\" requests. \n\n- How can I put an attribute in the HTTP request from my browser? I can't. So this can't possibly be \"request data\".\n- Would a middleware that expects a \"language\" attribute work without the middleware before it that puts it there? No. \n- How is this expressed in the type signature of that middleware? It isn't. Hidden dependency.\n\nCan it even be called \"middleware\" then, if it can't read a plain request and work things out, without relying on magically appearing attributes being placed there by a previous middleware?\n\nYou should realize (and I think you do realize) how fragile and implicitly coupled to one another the middleware chain becomes if you do that. Just like it would if you had \"global $language;\" that then everything reads back.\n\nBut let's step back from my way of expressing myself. You should focus more on your initial realization that relying on attributes for middleware to pass state to another down the line would lead to relying on a shared amongst all middleware, collision-prone, untyped hashmap, that promotes coupling. Don't call it $GLOBALS, but it's still a *shared amongst all middleware, collision-prone, untyped hashmap, that promotes coupling*. A place where you shove all things that don't belong as a part of the actual request. \n\nThe entire \"attributes\" feature of PSR-7 is a design mistake, but probably it'll take us 5-7 years to realize this when everyone starts hating how fragile their attribute-driven chains become.","score_hidden":null,"archived":null,"name":null,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"downs":null,"created_utc":"1441957384","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh38","link_id":"t3_3keqr2","parent_id":"t1_cuxp77m","score":"2","retrieved_on":"1444294742","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cuxpfye","subreddit":"PHP","ups":"2","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

{"body":"Based on what I saw on your blog and the description that you gave I think a few things happened that you might not have caught. \n\nThe original sample was well finished, smooth, and fit the box perfectly. It was probably a casting sample (based on the tooling charge) that seems like the case. The actual product pictures indicate something that was cut and milled from solid stock. The finishes are rough and not consistent with the sample. It's a much cheaper way to manufacture something.\n\nTo the people saying \"3D\" print: Don't. This would be a massive waste of time to print. If you have the time, making a mould and casting it would be the best option. \n\nA tip: it's best to work local if possible, things are obviously more expensive but you can get better results that way. If you can be onsite in China that counts as local - but you have to physically be there. People 'cut corners' everywhere doesn't matter if it's Thailand, Germany, or South Dakota. If you leave any details out of your description at all they will use that against you. \n\nI don't think that anybody working in China or anywhere else would 'scam' but unless you're familiar with various manufacturing techniques and the resulting finishes you open a large window for problems to enter. Machining some plastics can cause distortions as blade heat effects plastic (curvature and unfinished surfaces). Not requesting a new sample after switching manufacturing techniques was a bad idea. Injection moulded pieces would have smooth finish and the shrinkage from cooling process probably would have them fitting in your boxes perfectly. \n\nBut in the end you're selling some and as long as this hits breakeven I would chalk this up to a valuable learning experience. I like that you pursued it all the way. Best of luck!\n\n","score_hidden":null,"archived":null,"name":null,"author":"doublen00b","author_flair_text":null,"downs":null,"created_utc":"1442952029","subreddit_id":"t5_2qldo","link_id":"t3_3ly0k8","parent_id":"t3_3ly0k8","score":"3","retrieved_on":"1444519522","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cvak4eq","subreddit":"Entrepreneur","ups":"3","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

{"body":"I think the charm of the game was based on two things.\n\n&gt;1: It was free.\n\nBeing a free fame, anyone with a PC could play it. Nowadays, there's so much pay to win stuff in the game. There is the wheel of fortune thing, the ability to pay for membership with gold in game, a higher membership cost.\n\nAll of this has helped alienate and stagnate the player base. Most people are a ridiculously high level, or are bots. Despite Jagex's claim that they've stopped botting, you can still see the odd one or two.\n\nBecause the game is pay to win, players are left with two choices: either grind it out to compete with the elite majority of the game, or pay your way up the ladder with XP boosts, gold packages and equipment.\n\n&gt;2: it looked like crap\n\nI really hate the new art style and sound. It seems to me Jagex tried to imitate World of Warcraft. The new graphics, sounds and combat system must have taken ages to develop, but what does it add? Nothing.\n\nNobody plays Runescape for the graphics, Runescape should look basic, because then it would be easy to run. The exploration aspect of the game came from dungeon diving with your friends, and meeting new people to interact with.\n\nMaking the dungeons look all dark and gloomy hasn't enhanced the game one bit. When I stepped off tutorial island for the first time, I was in amazement, because there was this new world full off stuff and people. I felt small, a part of something big.\n\nGraphics can't replicate that. No amount of graphics can substitute a dedicated player base or a simple game system that worked.","score_hidden":null,"archived":null,"name":null,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"downs":null,"created_utc":"1442420410","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhwp","link_id":"t3_3l5viz","parent_id":"t1_cv3jwpb","score":"26","retrieved_on":"1444397296","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cv3marz","subreddit":"Games","ups":"26","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**\n\n**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\\\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**\n\n**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**\n\n**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**\n\nPlease visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] LOCATION - TITLE) to resubmit your post.

{"body":"StarCityGames is one of the biggest names, their brand is about as solid on the customer service end as you can get. You will pay more for cards from them, but they have very knowledgeable staff and you're not likely to get counterfeits from them. SCG has the infrastructure and they do charge accordingly. Their prices are on the more expensive side, but especially when buying multiple hundred dollar cards, its worth the extra peace of mind. They are also very consistent with their grading scale. \n\nTCG isn't whom you're always buying from. Some of their cards are shipped directly from them, but usually it's a private seller registered and selling through them. This means that like eBay individuals are competing based on price, so you're likely to pay less here. There is much more leeway on the card condition scale here, and I've read stories about people being sold fakes on TCGplayer. TCGPlayer also operates like eBay where it tries to protect the buyers, and to my knowledge typically sides with them. There are different levels of sellers, many smaller stores list inventory and are very good. Its still a mixed bag though.

{"body":"Simple mechanic work is absolutely a necessary skill to have these days.\n\nImagine this: you have a lifetime warranty for your starter. Part is covered, labor is not.\n\nYou break down about 30 miles from home, but your insurance offers free towing up to 100 miles.\n\nYou can either, A, have it towed to your house, remove the old starter yourself in 20 minutes, go redeem the warranty and get a new one for free, install the new one yourself in 20 minutes, and be done.\n\nOR.. B, you can have it towed to your preferred mechanic shop. Since they can't use your warranty (it goes by your last name &amp; phone number, and even if you call the store and give them permission to use your warranty, the shop/mechanic will refuse to since they get to charge you more for the part than it actually costs them.)\n\nSo instead, the shop charges it to their store credit. It costs $119 plus tax, minus the core charge.\n\nThey mark up the price to $220 plus tax, just for the part, then tack on an additional $140 for labor.. even though it literally takes 40 minutes, if that.\n\nI'd take (and have taken) option A several times before.. and not just with starters.\n\nAs long as you have a simple basic socket &amp; wrench set, and a basic set of screwdrivers, you can do probably 99% of stuff yourself these days thanks to YouTube :)\n\nAnd if there is anything YouTube can't help with, I have a free username and password to get in to EbscoHost's Auto Repair Center (http://search.ebscohost.com) and the login information can easily be found for anybody who needs it via a quick google search.\n\nFrom there, I can look up schematics, diagrams, step by step instructions with photos, etc. for literally any vehicle.\n\nI've done starters, alternators, serpentine belts, radiators, CV axles, all kinds of shit.\n\nHell, this week I have to take my driver's door panel off and fix the window.

{"body":"Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.\n\n**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.\n\n**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. \n\nNew users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.\n\n**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*\n\nIf you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).\n\n**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.\n\n* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      \n* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback\n* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback\n* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback\n* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  \n* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations\n* /r/remix - share your remixes\n* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*\n\nThe **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.\n\nAs you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!\n\n[permalink](http://reddit.com/r/Music/comments/3jjs74/can_someone_please_guess_this_song_im_fairly/)\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

{"body":"**Hero:** [Sir John Watson Gibson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Watson_Gibson) OBE (1885\u20131947) was an English civil engineer, key in developing the water supply infrastructure in the former British Empire, and instrumental in the design of Mulberry Harbour used in the Normandy landings\n\n**Villain:** [Shamawd Chambers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamawd_Chambers) (born March 10, 1989 in Markham, Ontario) is a Canadian football wide receiver who is currently playing with the Edmonton Eskimos\n\n**Reason:** [Juci Koml\u00f3s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juci_Koml%C3%B3s) (10 February 1919 - 5 April 2011) was a Hungarian film actress.\n\n\n*Sir Waterboy*\n\nThe noble Sir Gibson had once been a humble waterboy.  Every day, he would offer the athletes only the purest H20.  But he was ridiculed.  He was mocked.  The football players would hold him upside down and dunk his head into his own bucket of spring water.  But as a lad, Jonny Gibson never gave up on his team.  No matter how his team treated him, he\u2019d ensure they still had the best.\n\n\nYears Later, World War I began.  He went to the recruiter.  They refused him!  He wanted to fight for his country!  He wanted his team to win!  His best friend Buck made the cut, but he didn\u2019t\u2026 none the less, he still did all he could to help, and while all the other men were fighting a war for the survival their country, he left Europe and traveled abroad, increasing his education and skills.\n\n\nIt was on these journeys that he ran into the lovely Juci!  She was the most beautiful women he had ever met, one who had aspirations of becoming an actress.  They met in New York City, where she was studying to become a film actress.  She was an immigrant, of lowly birth, and had no money to provide for herself.  Jonny found her in a back alley near death.  She was so desperate for water that she was slurping water from a mud puddle.  He immediately grabbed one of his canteens, lifted her chin, and quenched her thirst with pure water he had brought from the glaciers in the Hungarian Alps.  She herself was from Hungary, and as soon as the water touch her lips, her first raspy words were, \u201cthis\u2026 is\u2026 from\u2026 my homeland\u2026 I can taste it!\u201d  He brought her to a hospital, and paid them to take care of her.  But he couldn\u2019t stay and get to know this beautiful young woman, he had to leave Juci behind and get back to Europe, for a new World War was beginning!  And he had to help his home team!\n\n\nDuring WWII he performed the task as waterboy once again, but at a higher level, only this time he was appreciated!  He ensured that British people had quality drinking water during the War to end all Wars.  He even used his superior knowledge of H20 to create mobile harbours which were used to invade Normandy!  Everyone loved him!  Nearly everyone\u2026\n\n\nHe had become so popular that Juci was finally able to locate him again.  She greeted him with \u201cYou are the most important man in my life, for you saved it!  It belongs only to you!\u201d  He was nervous, as he had never hoped to be in love.  He had only expected the rejection that a waterboy has come to expect in romance.  But this woman loved him.  She had even started acting!  She had everything going for her!  And it seemed that with Juci in his life, Jonny might finally have everything going for him.  But nothing was ever that easy\u2026\n\n\nIt was indeed a small world! For, one of Jonny Gibson childhood bullies just happened have been Juci\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9. His name was Shamawd Chambers.  Sham was a football player.  He was one of the ones who used to dunk Jonny into the water bucket.  Sham had even abandoned his own nation\u2019s football team and had joined Canada\u2019s instead.  As soon as Sham had heard of how \u201cthe Waterboy\u201d from school was courting his old flame, he flew over from Canada.  \n\n\nOne day, as Jonny was testing the PH level in a rooftop water tower, he felt a hand grasp firmly around his leg and drag him down the short ladder.  Jonny barely managed to land upright and on his feet.  He spun around and saw his old childhood bully.  \u201cChambers!  What are you doing here!\u201d said Jonny in surprise. \u201cI go by Sham.  I hear you are with my Juci, eh?\u201d \u201cYes, that\u2019s true!\u201d  \u201cI am not about to let a waterboy like you end up with a gal like Juci, eh!\u201d  \u201cWhy?!\u201d  The football player grabbed Jonny and pulled him near. He whispered to Jonny, \u201cShe dumped me. So, if I can\u2019t have her, then neither can you, Waterboy, eh!\u201d  Then with that he moved Jonny aside, and he walked away.\n\n\nWell poor Jonny was a timid creature, and so he began avoiding all contact with his beloved Juci. She tried to reach him, to contact him.  But to no avail. And so she went back to her home country.  She went on to become an actress in the popular Hungarian soap opera \u2018Neighbors\u2019.\n\n\nJonny was eventually knighted for being a good team player.  Juci even showed up, with her entourage, to show her support!  But Jonny was too scared to talk to her.  \n\nHe was after all, only a lowly waterboy\u2026\n\n\n(This is a very much not-historically accurate work of fiction!)\n","score_hidden":null,"archived":null,"name":null,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"downs":null,"created_utc":"1442071323","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","link_id":"t3_3km55g","parent_id":"t3_3km55g","score":"3","retrieved_on":"1444317568","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cuz11i8","subreddit":"WritingPrompts","ups":"3","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

{"body":"I've already said the Amnesia story before, so I'll go with this one.\n\nSo, my family has a cottage in the middle of Muskoka. I go up there a few times a year for a few weekends and generally enjoy myself. Because the cottage itself doesn't have enough rooms to fit my whole family, someone usually has sleep in the cabin down the hill and someone else in the dingy basement. I am normally one of those guys.\n\nNow, I don't know if you've ever been in a place like that before, but at night, in the middle of the forest, it is pitch black. I mean you cannot see anything, not your hand, not the trees, anything. Even if you wait for your eyes to adjust to the dark, nothing. You may as well be in a void. Understandably, you always bring a flashlight.\n\nOne time I decided to go sleep in the cabin, cause it's nice and isolated and quiet and all that. I grabbed one of the crappy flashlights we have, and walked all the way over to it. It's a pretty big property, so that takes a few minutes, and the door was locked. The lights were off in the cottage, and I decided to just walk back for the key.\n\nShouldn't be a surprise, the flashlight died suddenly. \n\nBoom, blackness. Middle of the forest at night, straight out of a bad creepypasta. No noise, no light, just the sounds of insects and leaves crinkling under your feet. No sense of direction, no way of knowing where you are, absolutely no idea how get to safety in one of the creepiest possible places you can be. I panicked a little and basically just chose a direction to walk off in randomly. \n\nBy luck, I ended up in a clearing where we kept cut wood after a few blind minutes, so I could see a little, and I knew where the cottage was relative to it. I got inside, got a better flashlight, went back to the cabin, forgot the key again, ran back, got it, went to the cabin, and went to sleep. I still fucking hate walking through there at night.\n","score_hidden":null,"archived":null,"name":null,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"downs":null,"created_utc":"1442808047","subreddit_id":"t5_342g7","link_id":"t3_3lrffe","parent_id":"t3_3lrffe","score":"5","retrieved_on":"1444487426","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cv8p9as","subreddit":"fireemblemcasual","ups":"5","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

{"body":"I'm around. My surgery isn't till friday. Half if not 75% of the games on ttt were by my friend. I don't want to be disingenuous and pretend I played that many games on that account. Although I still have easily ~500 ophelia games under my belt. I still was alright at ophelia though. I'll send OP a message.\n\n@OP:\n\nIf you want to learn ophelia the best way is to go into a practice mode and practice microing your minions and the different jungle spots. I don't play hon anymore but I'd always have mino bound to  two (bind units with control + number key), skeletons on 4, catman on 3,  and the entire full group as 6. It takes a lot of repetition and practice to get right.\n\nOther than that, you should learn that almost all of the creeps have aura's or spells you can use. Even small ones. Know the radius's of the aura's and know that enemies can see you. Things like knowing snorespitter slows, werebeast enchanter grants vision, minotaur grants aura's, catman slows are 100% vital. Ophelia is just about mechanics as she is about knowledge.\n\nAdditionally you have to understand how your E works in rotation with your other spells. Your creeps HP and I think movespeed/damage are buffed by your E spell, however sometimes at level 3 instead of getting that buff you want more levels into your slow or your nuke. Your W spell sends people back home, and is more useful midgame than your slow, but your slow combined with proper creeps and/or timing and you can net way more kills. Keep in mind your slow tacks on a debuff that will make all damage scale more as you level it, so the math is on your side when using it over your nuke early game.\n\nAs far as items go, the only real core item on ophelia is mana ring and astrolabe. Red boots, plated grieves, and treads are all fine. Other than that your items are situational. Vestments is pretty often needed, but I wouldn't call it core. Beyond that, barrier if they have a lot of magic, tablet if they have kraken or pharoah or such, hellflower or sheep if you need CC and have good farm, staff if you are overfarmed and are trying to end game very early, and that's about it.\n\nother than that, you need to watch zlapped play ophelia (I'm sure he has videos on youtube) and chessie's ophelia guide.","score_hidden":null,"archived":null,"name":null,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"downs":null,"created_utc":"1441242215","subreddit_id":"t5_2r497","link_id":"t3_3j7nzo","parent_id":"t1_cunkjaf","score":"2","retrieved_on":"1444139230","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cuosmyu","subreddit":"HeroesofNewerth","ups":"2","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

{"body":"&gt; I find it confusing that people think if you are a feminist you are incapable of caring about other things.\n\nI never said or implied that. I said I'm not a feminist because I work on broader human rights that impact everyone and have nothing to do with gender. They also have nothing to do with lgbt rights. Working on broad spectrum human rights doesn't automatically make me a supporter of lgbt rights just because there is an overlap with human rights, but it also doesn't preclude me from being a supporter of lgbt rights. The fact that I volunteer in that capacity and donate to lgbt organizations makes me a supporter of lgbt rights. \n\nSaying that working in human rights doesn't automatically make one a feminist in no way implies that a feminist doesn't care for human rights. In fact, as feminism typically embraces many general human rights the logical conclusion is that feminists do work in human rights. All terriers are dogs but not all dogs are terriers.

No one finds it fun telling someone that you aren't their baseball teammate from high school. It is not entertaining in the least to explain to someone that your past six years have consisted of 16 hour shifts in a New York high rise, you've never heard of Helmand, and that you watched Super Bowl 44 on a web stream and not in a sleazy Georgia bar next to a drunk staff sergeant from Chicago.\n\nWhen someone mistakes you for someone else, it's our subconscious desire not to listen. We want to carry on with our lives, to propagate the status quo, to try our damnedest not to give a fuck about the backstory of the guy in front of us in the queue.\n\nBut sometimes, we need to listen.\n\nI was walking back to my hotel room in Moscow. My week-long vacation had gone splendidly. I saw many sights, met a nice brunette at a cafe not far from the center, and even got to watch a match of soccer at their local stadium, I believe it was against Sweden. The home team won, and everyone left to get blisteringly drunk at their bar of choice. \n\nWhen in Rome, do as the Romans do.\n\nI was stumbling home a few hours later when I felt a hand tap on my shoulder. \"Volodya! Fancy seeing you here. I thought you preferred the northern side of town.\" \n\nA tall man in a flawless suit strolled up beside me an put an arm on my shoulder. I turned to him and drunkenly spat out \"\u0427\u0442\u043e?\", trying really hard to make my American accent. Usually people realize at this point that they're talking to a tourist. \n\nThen again, usually I don't have a BAC of 0.35. \n\nThe man continued in Russian, I barely made anything out, it was something about meeting me, having big plans. I decided to try and shake him off again.  \n\n\"\u0427\u0442\u043e?\"\n\nI suddenly felt extremely light headed, and slumped down hard against this guy's shoulder. \"\u0427\u0442\u043e?\" \"\u0427\u0442\u043e?\" \"\u0427\u0442\u043e?\" I kept trying to say. I managed about three repetitions before going black.\n\nI awoke on a couch with a throbbing, throbbing headache. Outside it was still dark. he sat in front of me with a huge platter of pickled herring and two cups of tea.\n\n\"Good, you're awake. We need to hurry up here/\"\n\nI hoisted myself to a sitting position. The man started talking, yet I couldn't make out anything. Nor did I really want to. Maybe this time he'll finally hear my accent.\n\n\"\u0427\u0442\u043e?\"\n\nThe guy suddenly burst into laughter for an inexplicable reason. I realized my accent still wasn't audible and that maybe, just maybe, it'd be better if I just tried to stumble through this conversation instead of blow it up in the middle. My hand reached for my back pocket, where my phone thankfully was. I tapped on the Google Translate app just as he was starting to speak again. Speech to text is a brilliant invention, by the way.\n\n\"'...of that pickled herring if you're gonna be any use in the long run. Anyway, our plans. Have you gotten in contact with the commander of the Voskresyensk detachment?\"\n\nThe words flashed on my phone screen. Quickly glancing at it and not fully comprehending the depth of the matter, I attempted a slurred \"\u0414\u0430\".\n\n\"Very good. I've gotten in touch with the men at the silos to the east of the city. They'll be loyal to us. Our men in Petersburg, Omsk, Volgograd, Rostov, and Ekaterinburg all seem to be proceeding as planned as well. All that's left is to turn some of the men in the city. There's the 4th Motorized, the 29th Infantry, 37 Guards, and the Preobrazhensky Corps. The 4th is already on our side, we need at least one other. Can you do this before Sunday?\"\n\nThe translator spit out the man's speech into nice, black, 10pt Arial font. i looked at it for a moment and suddenly was jolted awake by the whole meaning of it. \n\nThis was a coup.\n\n\"\u0414\u0430, \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e\". I said, turning to the man.\n\n\"Good, then we're done here. Remember, Sunday morning, the armored caravan will be waiting for you to take you to the Kremlin. You're to be our Minister of Defense. I knew you'd want a chance to use those nuclear weapons your men helped design in the 90's.\"  \n\n\"\u0414\u043e \u0441\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\" I managed to blurt out as my body rocketed off towards two large, ornate doors. I burst through the doors into the cold Muscovian night. I had no clue where to go from here, and then jackhammer in my head wasn't helping. A yellow car approached in the distance, and I started crazily waving my arm, trying to draw the taxi's attention. I didn't know where in the world I'd want that taxi to take me. But it was urgent I do something.\n\nI needed to propagate the status quo.","score_hidden":null,"archived":null,"name":null,"author":"Buggie111","author_flair_text":null,"downs":null,"created_utc":"1442971764","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3nb","link_id":"t3_3m02lm","parent_id":"t3_3m02lm","score":"1","retrieved_on":"1444525231","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cvavymb","subreddit":"WritingPrompts","ups":"1","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

{"body":"/u/akrawczy\n\nSorry, your submission was removed from /r/listentothis because your account doesn't yet meet our minimum requirements for submitting music. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just listen and enjoy the music. Please read this entire reply - we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.\n\n**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines.](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) If you are planning to submit your own music in listentothis, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit.](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) Violating these site-wide rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.\n\n**New users** should take the time to read the [listentothis introduction](/r/listentothis/wiki/reddiquette) to learn what this place is all about, and how we operate. Keep in mind, if you haven't got anything positive to say in your comment, it's best not to say anything. Earning downvotes will block your comments, so comment wisely.\n\nNew users must maintain a minimum level of positive community contributions to submit music links in listentothis. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of 50-100 submissions each day. We can't tell you what this score is. We can only tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.\n\n**If you wish to promote music in listentothis without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links.](http://www.reddit.com/advertising) These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes. Everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*\n\nIf you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit faq.](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq)\n\n**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** listentothis is not the place where you want to submit your first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are however many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you, who will give you feedback and advice, even technical tips, on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.\n\n* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback\n* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback\n* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback\n* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations\n* /r/remix - share your remixes\n* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*\n* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar\n* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks\n\nThe **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources, they *will* help you become a better musician.\n\nAs you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in listentothis, and prove that you are not a spammer. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers. Thank you for understanding, and good luck in your music career!\n\n[permalink](http://reddit.com/r/listentothis/comments/3jkwal/just_a_gent_waveless_electronic/)\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

{"body":"In my experience, looks aren't *that* important for a guy to get a girl... In fact, in my country it's common to see smoking hot 8-9 females walking around with 5-6 males. It would appear that these girls want the extra security in a relationship of knowing they are more attractive than their boyfriends. Or ugly guys just tend to earn more money in my country, who knows.\n\nI'm 5'11, thick dark hair, good facial hair, noticeably fit, great teeth and decent facial features... I'd say I'm a 7-8 and I've been single for like 4 years now. Girls generally don't want me. I get ignored by most girls on Tinder eventually if I try to be myself. I can be a prick and use game to get laid, sure, but it really is meaningless and empty. It makes my soul feel dirty. Even after I realised it was soul destroying,  I used to get horny anyway and pick up chicks late at night but now I'm just depressed as hell feeling like I'll never find what I want. It's not a great life having loveless sex with loads of different people. Nothing compares to making love to someone you care about...\n\nAnyway, my point is that you've nothing to worry about. Looks and what you think gives you a disadvantage with women is not important and might even be part of the reason you end up in a good relationship. I have just as much luck as any average guy when it comes to love, even though I'm constantly reminded that I'm pretty attractive. Some girls even used to tell me that I look like I probably sleep with everyone and can't be trusted because I'm handsome.

{"body":"Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.\n\n**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.\n\n**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. \n\nNew users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.\n\n**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*\n\nIf you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).\n\n**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.\n\n* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      \n* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback\n* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback\n* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback\n* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  \n* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations\n* /r/remix - share your remixes\n* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*\n\nThe **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.\n\nAs you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!\n\n[permalink](https://reddit.com/r/Music/comments/3mfmiw/help_i_have_no_idea_what_im_doing/)\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

{"body":"Hi pinkshirtjoe!\n\n\nThank-you for your comment, but unfortuneately it has been removed because it links to Facebook. Facebook is designed to contain a lot of private and personal information, usually found in comments in the form of photos and names. This basically makes Facebook incompatible with the rules of reddit. \n\nHere are some alternatives...\n\n * if it's a photo you want to show, you can download it or screenshot it and upload it to an anonymous image file hosting website like imgur.com or minus.com. If it has some personal info on it, you should probably block that out (blur, black rectangles).  And don't forget to read the image rules on /r/atheism before posting.\n \n * if it's a special Facebook page, you can just mention its name and remind users to use the inner Facebook search engine\n\n * if it's a discussion, you can take a screenshot (and color out or blur names and faces) and upload it to some image file hosting website...  or you can copy/paste the text content\n\n * if it's a video, try looking for a copy of that video on some other website, like YouTube, it may already be posted. If you can't find it and can't download and upload the video somewhere else, the best idea is to summarize the points in the video or describe the relevant parts of it.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

{"body":"Does diphenhydramine help you calm down? I took just 75 mg yesterday (which is a moderately large dose for someone who has stayed off it for a couple of months, since one side effect of it is weight gain and I don't want to get larger) and I felt this horrible, sinister vibe in the air starting about 30 minutes after I took it. It didn't help me fall asleep at all. :/ \n\nA family member of mine brought his girlfriend over and I felt really nervous, nauseous, and unable to make eye contact with her. I probably made a bad first impression. The feeling of an ominous atmosphere around me (you know, that feeling that you get when you feel that something bad is right around the corner) continued for about three hours until I watched an h3h3 productions video on YouTube and finally laughed the tension away. One thing I've realized over the past couple of months is that humor is one of the best antidotes for anxiety. \n\nLaugh at yourself and stay strong, man. The same goes for Eric. The worst always passes, and better things always come as long as you're patient enough. I imagine myself sometimes as a light switch on a wall. One end (the \"off\" direction) is labeled \"Suffering,\" and the \"on\" direction is labeled \"Laughter.\" I choose laughter, and suddenly anything and everything can be funny. I was nervous in one of my college classes last week. I was slightly drunk and tried to reposition myself in my chair, only to bump my head with the wall behind me. I realized how silly it all was, me having downed Skol Vodka at 6:00 in the morning only to go to class 40 minutes early and find myself sitting in the back of the room drunk as a skunk, and burst out laughing. \n\nI sometimes imagine myself as a clown on a stage who is performing for some unseen observer. Seeing life this way makes my fears (my social anxiety) seem trivial. Also, one thing that has helped me big-time is my attitude of \"Give No Fucks.\" If I'm in class and I fear that a professor will call on me, I just come up with words in my mind that relate to what the class has been discussing. Life is just a matter of words. I watched the Republican debate this week. So many of the candidates (full disclosure:  I'm torn between supporting Trump or supporting Paul) just regurgitated well-memorized talking points and empty words. Some didn't even go into specifics. For the most part, they didn't consider the potential consequences or the human costs of the \"Let's bomb Iran!\" attitude, or the \"Drugs are bad, m'kay!\" attitude. It was 90% theater and 5% substance.\n\nYou'll win as long as you say something that is somewhat reasonable, don't make too big of a mistake, and have a comeback, no matter how weak it may be.\n\nStick to a mantra and stay confident. It gets better.\n\nEdit:  And I don't think I stated the importance of faith in this post. I believe that whatever is running the universe, whether it be called God or the Matrix, must be omnipotent and is probably incomprehensibly large and complex and therefore capable of sentience, and with sentience comes the potential for empathy to arise. Although we are but small nodes in the larger framework of this Supreme Being, I feel that, if we are in deep enough trouble, God (or \"the Program\") may reach out to us and to the variables surrounding us in an attempt to better our condition. Every consciousness in existence must be of some major value to the simulation in which we live.\n\nEric, pray and stay strong, my friend. /u/Anatta-Phi, the same goes for you. You are not alone.","score_hidden":null,"archived":null,"name":null,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"downs":null,"created_utc":"1442628204","subreddit_id":"t5_2zgq4","link_id":"t3_3lgqcx","parent_id":"t1_cv6ge9a","score":"1","retrieved_on":"1444450386","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cv6jsf1","subreddit":"DigitalCartel","ups":"1","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

{"body":"I like Elibe, so a sequel could be fun. My first thought was Bern and its potential reconstruction, but that might be too similar to Radiant Dawn part 1 or 2. Etruria has already been cleaned up, and Lycia has been done and dusted. Ilia and Sacae to me don't have enough to be a main setting.\n\nThe best way to do it would be to jump forward at least twenty years or so, maybe more. The main issue is that I don't see a reason for another major war and the leaders of the different countries are all pals and would not fight each other, and would perhaps go some way to aid them in a crisis within their own realm. \n\nYou could skip forward a number of decades or a century and make a new Lycian kingdom the bad guys, that could be interesting. I think having the House of Ostia (or Pherae, if you go with Roy x Lilina) as aggressor as a basic concept would instantly lead to something unique.\n\nAs I said though, it's hard to think about what one could do. Like Jugdral after IV, the whole continent is too settled. I feel you'd need to move so far forward in time the question them becomes why bother using that setting to begin with.

{"body":"Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.\n\n**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.\n\n**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. \n\nNew users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.\n\n**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*\n\nIf you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).\n\n**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.\n\n* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      \n* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback\n* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback\n* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback\n* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  \n* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations\n* /r/remix - share your remixes\n* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*\n\nThe **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.\n\nAs you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it.

Please read this entire reply - we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.\n\n**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines.](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) If you are planning to submit your own music in listentothis, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit.](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) Violating these site-wide rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.\n\n**New users** should take the time to read the [listentothis introduction](/r/listentothis/wiki/reddiquette) to learn what this place is all about, and how we operate. Keep in mind, if you haven't got anything positive to say in your comment, it's best not to say anything. Earning downvotes will block your comments, so comment wisely.\n\nNew users must maintain a minimum level of positive community contributions to submit music links in listentothis. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of 50-100 submissions each day. We can't tell you what this score is. We can only tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.\n\n**If you wish to promote music in listentothis without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links.](http://www.reddit.com/advertising) These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes.

This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are however many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you, who will give you feedback and advice, even technical tips, on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.\n\n* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback\n* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback\n* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback\n* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations\n* /r/remix - share your remixes\n* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*\n* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar\n* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks\n\nThe **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music.

Put in your two weeks notice, wrap up any loose ends, be as gracious as possible, say goodbye to and thank your coworkers, and go for it. Maybe this sparks an all out exodus, but unless you're openly inciting rebellion (and even then), that's not your problem. Maybe this means that the powers that be decide that your new manager is a chump and they get rid of him; again, even though it sucks, unless you're actively lobbying for it (and even then), it's not your fault. It's not particularly savory, but it's part of business.","score_hidden":null,"archived":null,"name":null,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"downs":null,"created_utc":"1441154244","subreddit_id":"t5_2sdpm","link_id":"t3_3jafes","parent_id":"t3_3jafes","score":"16","retrieved_on":"1444119021","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cunml26","subreddit":"cscareerquestions","ups":"16","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

{"body":"Absolutely!\n\nAbout 4 years ago, I was driving on hwy 10. It was rush hour, and the traffic was going in such a way that you would speed up to 60 for about a mile, then dead stop. Speed up to 60, dead stop...... It had been going on so long, that I stopped speeding up to 60 in between, and was lazily driving up to the next stopped area. As I drive a truck, I sit up high, and could see the next stopped mess about quarter mile up. So I was going about 40 up to it.\n\nWell, some kid in a BMW z whatever those things are, didn't like my plan at all. First, I assume that he couldn't see the sea of brake lights and stopped cars ahead over my large truck. And second, his little sports car probably stops on a dime, MUCH unlike my truck. Anyhow...\n\nThis kid drives on the right hand shoulder to pass me (that's right folks, I was in the right lane) and proceeds to flip me off, brake check me, get next to me and start swerving into my lane, etc. Pretty much every dick move there is. 2 problems with his plan: first, my truck weighs 4000lbs more than his car. If we wreck, he's gonna be in a wheelchair, and I'm gonna need to buff out some scratches. Second, his behaviour and driving were so erratic and bad, 9 people called 911 to report him. I know this because when I finally escaped him by exiting last minute and calling 911 myself, they were already well aware of the situation.\n\nBecause SO many people had called, the police took it pretty seriously. Went to his house and everything. They called me from there and asked for a description of him to verify. Turns out, He was a 24 year old lad, driving his dad's sports car. They charged him with multiple charges. Reckless driving, speeding, etc. 9 charges in all. Who's his dad? The fire chief for Anoka.\n\nWould have loved to be a fly on the wall at that guys house that night.","score_hidden":null,"archived":null,"name":null,"author":"jakjg","author_flair_text":"cold in the northern burbs","downs":null,"created_utc":"1442629308","subreddit_id":"t5_2r7ar","link_id":"t3_3lg1l3","parent_id":"t1_cv6iste","score":"2","retrieved_on":"1444450625","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"cv6kamp","subreddit":"TwinCities","ups":"2","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":""}

{"body":"thats too long and looks like just another bullshit about japan, like one that weebs write somewhere on the internet. ive read a bunch of cultural critiques about japan in english but most of them were full of misleadings and pointless. basically, those who are really into japan or concern about are always too overreacting. its even laughable to me. particularly, they try so hard to argue about some sexual stuff in japan, despite noticing the fact that japanese are not so different from them westerners at all. my guess is that they just have a desire to act like a cultural expert like sjws. although i must agree work conditions in japanese companies are one of the worst in the world. it could be much more terrible than in developing countries.\n","score_hidden":null,"archived":null,"name":null,"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_text":null,"downs":null,"created_utc":"1441472338","subreddit_id":"t5_36v9d","link_id":"t3_3jr5vj","parent_id":"t3_3jr5vj","score":"-2","retrieved_on":"1444188113","controversiality":"1","gilded":"0","id":"curmsap","subreddit":"newsokur","ups":"-2","distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":null}

While some of what you are saying is true, there is such a huge amount of wiggle room when we examine things closely, that i think the term and its connotation are up for debate. Do WASP's have a huge advantage over most Americans? Yes they do, but a huge portion of \"white\" americans are not WASPS. They're catholics, jews, muslims, secular humanists, buddhists and atheists.

{"body":"For the first two points I can't really answer accurately as I haven't delved too much into theory-crafting.\n\n\n1. Assuming that + attack is the best stat, then + stats are better than + attack, only if the attack they provide is equal or higher, since they provide secondary bonuses. For example, +20 Dexterity is better than +10% attack for Rogues, because it provides both +10% attack and +20% Critical Damage bonus. \n\n\n2. Base weapon damage matters for abilities that deal % damage of weapon damage. From that point on, though, it depends how much higher is the weapon's base damage and how much lower is the + attack it provides. If you don't have abilities that rely on base weapon damage, then + attack would be preferable if it's substantially higher that the other weapon, while, at the same time, the base weapon damage is only minimally lower than the higher base damage weapon. That's, at least, my guess.\n\n\n3. High tier materials are sold in Black Emporium and in the first camp you claim in Decent.
